"""INS-067 — Shrinkage Detection × Police.uk Crime × CCTV Event Logs (Retail).

Claim: 'UK retailers hitting 1.68% shrink on a £500k store = £8,400/year lost;
local crime rate spikes from police.uk data predict elevated shoplifting 2-3
months ahead.'

Public-data-validatable leg: shoplifting crime exists at street-level granularity
across UK retail postcodes via the Police.uk API (no key required).

We run two checks:
  1. Existence — Police.uk returns shoplifting records for every retail anchor
     postcode at the claimed street-level granularity.
  2. Distribution — across the retail anchor postcodes, the variance in monthly
     shoplifting count is large enough to support 'spike detection' as a leading
     indicator (mean exceeds 5 incidents/month threshold by ≥ 1σ).

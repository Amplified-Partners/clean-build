"""Existence test: 'the data needed to support this recipe is actually available
at the granularity claimed'.

Cheapest test class — runs first to gate everything else. Verdict logic:
  PROVEN     — every required source returns a non-empty payload at the
               claimed granularity.
  PLAUSIBLE  — at least one source is reachable and consistent with the claim,
               but a key is missing for full validation OR coverage is partial.
  DISPROVEN  — required source returns 404/empty/no rows at the claimed
               granularity.

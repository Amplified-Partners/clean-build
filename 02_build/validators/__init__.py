"""Public-data validators for the Amplified Partners insight catalogue.

Tests insights from `01_truth/schemas/research-index/00-insight-catalogue_v1.md`
against UK public datasets and emits one of:

- PROVEN     — public data quantitatively confirms the claim at the granularity
               required.
- PLAUSIBLE  — data is consistent with the claim but underpowered, or one leg
               of the recipe is open-data confirmable while the other requires
               client data with published research support.
- DISPROVEN  — public data contradicts the claim.
- BLOCKED    — required source is unreachable in this environment (e.g. needs
               an API key not yet provisioned). Recorded so the gap is visible.

Per AMP-67 / AMP-59. Vertical-agnostic by design so AMP-64/65/66/68 reuse the
same machinery.

Vertical sub-packages (each self-contained until the shared layer matures):
  retail      AMP-66  (this PR — `validators/retail/`)
  prof_svcs   AMP-67  (`validators/validations/profservices.py`, shared scaffold)
  trades      AMP-64  (sibling)
  hospitality AMP-65  (sibling)
  universal   AMP-68  (sibling)

Once all five land, the AMP-66 retail self-contained subpackage will lift its
fetchers + test classes into the shared `sources/` + `tests/` layer to match
the AMP-67 convention.

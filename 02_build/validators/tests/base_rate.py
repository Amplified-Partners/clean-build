"""Base-rate test class.

"X% of UK <segment> firms exhibit Y." The validator measures the rate from
public data and compares against the claimed rate.

Bands:

- ``PROVEN`` if ``|measured - claimed| / claimed <= tolerance`` (default 0.20),
  or if directional support is unambiguous (claim says "majority" and measured > 0.5).
- ``PLAUSIBLE`` if data confirms the population exists at the granularity claimed
  but the rate is not yet measurable from public alone.
- ``DISPROVEN`` if the measured rate contradicts the claim by more than tolerance.

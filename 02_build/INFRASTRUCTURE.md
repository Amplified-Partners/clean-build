# Infrastructure Manifest

Single source of truth for what is running on Amplified Partners infrastructure. If it is not listed here, we do not know about it. If it is listed here, this is what it does.

**Server:** `amplified-core` — Hetzner AX162-R (`135.181.161.131`)
**OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS (Noble Numbat)
**CPU:** AMD EPYC 9454P 48-Core (96 threads)
**RAM:** 252 GB
**Disk:** 1.8 TB RAID (`/dev/md2`), 170 GB used (11%)

---

## How to read this

- **Running** = container is up and healthy (or up without healthcheck).
- **Paused** = intentionally stopped; data preserved; restart command provided.
- **Stopped** = exited and not expected to run (init containers, deprecated services).
- Each entry says what it does in plain language. If you don't know what something means, the entry is wrong — fix it.

---

## Network topology

All application containers run on `amplified-net` (Docker bridge). Traefik handles external HTTPS routing via `api.amplifiedpartners.ai`. Internal services communicate by container name on the Docker network.

| Network | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `amplified-net` | Primary application network (all services) |
| `traefik-public` | Traefik edge routing |
| `docker_default` | Docker default (Temporal, some Postgres) |
| `amplified_default` | Legacy default network |

---

## Core platform services

These are shared infrastructure that other services depend on.

| Container | Image | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **traefik** | `traefik:latest` | Running | Reverse proxy + TLS. Routes `api.amplifiedpartners.ai` to backend services. Ports 80/443 exposed to internet. |
| **postgres** | `postgres:16-alpine` | Running | Primary PostgreSQL database. DB: `amplified_machine`. Used by amplified-core, finance-engine, ch-pipeline, marketing engine. Internal port 5432. |
| **docker-postgres-1** | `postgres:16-alpine` | Running | Secondary PostgreSQL instance. Exposed on host port 5432. Used by Temporal and other stacks. |
| **redis** | `redis:7-alpine` | Running | Shared cache and message broker. Internal port 6379. |
| **minio** | `minio/minio:latest` | Running | S3-compatible object storage. Internal port 9000. |
| **minio-init** | `minio/mc:latest` | Stopped | One-time bucket initialisation. Ran 2026-03-11. Not needed again unless buckets change. |

## AI / ML services

| Container | Image | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **ollama** | `ollama/ollama:latest` | Running | Local LLM inference server. Hosts llama3.1-8b/70b, qwen3-coder-30b, nomic-embed-text. Internal port 11434 on `amplified-net`. Host-loopback bind `127.0.0.1:11434` (added 2026-05-03 per AMP-46 — for Beast-side scripts). Public HTTPS via Traefik at `ollama.beast.amplifiedpartners.ai`. **Resource caps**: `cpus: '48'` + `memory: 96G` under `deploy.resources.limits` (CPU cap added 2026-05-04 per AMP-75 — the 70B runner had been hitting 4806 % CPU and pushing host load >46). |
| **litellm** | `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-latest` | Running | LLM proxy — unified API for local (Ollama) and remote (Anthropic, OpenAI, Moonshot, DeepSeek, xAI) models. Internal port 4000 on `amplified-net`. Host-loopback bind `127.0.0.1:4000` (added 2026-05-03 per AMP-71 — for Beast-side scripts). Public HTTPS via Traefik at `litellm.beast.amplifiedpartners.ai`. Routes by `simple-shuffle` with failover chains; **does not** classify by cost. |
| **token-proxy** | `amplified/token-proxy:latest` (built locally from `Amplified-Partners/cost-tools`) | Running (healthy) | Anthropic-only reverse proxy. Sonnet→Haiku model-layer routing on extractive/classification prompts; prompt caching; semantic similarity cache (Qdrant `llm_cache`, 0.95, 24h TTL); native context compaction; daily $100 budget circuit-breaker; per-agent cost log. Container port 8088 (host-bound to `127.0.0.1:8088` for diagnostics; agents reach it via DNS name `token-proxy:8088` on `amplified-net`). Compose file: `/opt/amplified/apps/cost-tools/docker-compose.yml`. RUNBOOK: `cost-tools/RUNBOOK.md`. Linear: AMP-28. |
| **langfuse** | `langfuse/langfuse:latest` | Running | LLM observability — traces, costs, prompt versioning. |

**To wire an agent through the token-proxy:**
```bash
# inside the agent's container, on amplified-net:
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://token-proxy:8088
```
Reversal: unset the env var. 30 seconds, no restart of the proxy needed.

**Self-heal layers for token-proxy:**
1. Docker `restart: always` + `healthcheck: /proxy/stats` every 30s (handles ~90% of transient failures).
2. Optional Temporal workflow checking `/proxy/stats` every 5 min and running `docker compose restart token-proxy` on 2 consecutive failures (pattern matches existing `cove-*` self-heal).
3. RUNBOOK at `cost-tools/RUNBOOK.md` — 5 failure modes (F1–F5), per-failure 30-second fix, escalation rule (2 attempts → rollback → page Ewan via Telegram).

## Changelog

### v5 — 2026-05-04

Ollama row updated to reflect AMP-75 fix:

- Added `cpus: '48'` (48 logical CPUs = half the 96-thread box) under `deploy.resources.limits` in `/opt/amplified/apps/ollama/docker-compose.yml` and the in-repo mirror.
- Pre-fix: `HostConfig.NanoCpus = 0` (no cap); 70B runner observed at 4363–4806 % CPU, host load 44–46.
- Post-fix: `HostConfig.NanoCpus = 48000000000`; 8B smoke test peaked at 4444 % CPU under the cap; host load dropped to 40.60 within 2 minutes of recreate.
- Container recreate was clean (`Status=running`, all 4 models reachable via `/api/tags`).

Linear: AMP-75. Reversible: remove the `cpus:` line + `docker compose up -d ollama`.

### v4 — 2026-05-03

LiteLLM row updated to reflect [AMP-71](https://linear.app/amplifiedpartners/issue/AMP-71/) fix (sibling of AMP-46):

- Added host-loopback bind `127.0.0.1:4000` (so Beast-side scripts can reach LiteLLM at the canonical loopback address instead of churning bridge IPs).
- Made the existing public Traefik route (`litellm.beast.amplifiedpartners.ai`) explicit — was previously omitted.
- Listed the full provider set the proxy fronts (Anthropic, OpenAI, Moonshot, DeepSeek, xAI in addition to Ollama) instead of just OpenAI/Anthropic.
- Preserved the AMP-28 routing clarification (`simple-shuffle` with failover chains; does not classify by cost) on the same row.
- LiteLLM compose **not** mirrored into the repo because the live file embeds plaintext API keys for six providers — see [AMP-72](https://linear.app/amplifiedpartners/issue/AMP-72/) for the secrets-hardening follow-up.

Verified end-to-end: host loopback, in-net Docker DNS, and Traefik public route all return 200 on `/health/liveliness`.

### v3 — 2026-05-03

Ollama row updated to reflect AMP-46 fix:

- Added host-loopback bind `127.0.0.1:11434` (so Beast-side scripts can reach Ollama at the canonical loopback address instead of churning bridge IPs).
- Made the existing public Traefik route (`ollama.beast.amplifiedpartners.ai`) explicit — was previously omitted from this manifest.
- Listed the full set of currently-loaded models (llama3.1-8b/70b, qwen3-coder-30b, nomic-embed-text) instead of just llama3.1-8b.
- Added pointer to the in-repo compose mirror at `02_build/compose/ollama/docker-compose.yml`.

Verified end-to-end: host loopback, in-net Docker DNS, and Traefik public route all return 200.

Signed-by: Devon-a9a7 | 2026-05-03 | devin-a9a78d0c72d9491aa3a70b18cb741936

### v2 — 2026-05-03

- Added **token-proxy** container row under § AI / ML services: Anthropic-only reverse proxy on `amplified-net`, Sonnet→Haiku model-layer routing on extractive/classification prompts, prompt caching, semantic similarity cache (Qdrant `llm_cache`, 0.95, 24h TTL), native context compaction, daily $100 budget circuit-breaker. Container reachable as `token-proxy:8088` on `amplified-net`; host-bound to `127.0.0.1:8088` for diagnostics. Compose file at `/opt/amplified/apps/cost-tools/docker-compose.yml`. RUNBOOK in the `cost-tools` repo.
- Added the cost-tools stack to the **Compose file locations** table for symmetry with every other compose-managed container.
- Clarified the **litellm** row: routes by `simple-shuffle` with failover chains; **does not** classify by cost. Cost-tier classification is the proxy's job (per `00_authority/TAXONOMY.md` v2/v3 lock).
- Documented the **self-heal layers** for token-proxy (Docker `restart: always` + healthcheck on `/proxy/stats`; Temporal workflow check every 5 min; RUNBOOK escalation rule — 2 attempts → rollback → page Ewan via Telegram).
- Added agent-wiring instructions: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://token-proxy:8088` on agents that hit Anthropic directly; reversible in 30 sec by unsetting the env var.
- No changes to existing rows; all edits are additive. Linear: AMP-28.

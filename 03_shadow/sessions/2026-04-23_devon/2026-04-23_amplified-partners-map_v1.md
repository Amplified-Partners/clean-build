## How to read this document

**What it is:** a map of what *exists* across Ewan's Amplified Partners landscape as of 2026-04-23 — repositories, infrastructure, documents, running code, specs, decisions, gaps.

**What it is not:** a plan. Not a strategy. Not a recommendation. Not a ranking. Not an opinion about what to build next.

**Status tokens** (from `clean-build/00_authority/MANIFEST.md` + convention tonight):

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[CONFIRMED]` | I have direct evidence in code, docs, or Ewan's own words tonight |
| `[INFERRED]` | My reading from pattern; Ewan has not said it in these words |
| `[DECISION REQUIRED]` | Active open question that must be answered to move forward |
| `[TERMINOLOGY TBC]` | Naming collision or ambiguity; canonical name not settled |
| `[SOURCE REQUIRED]` | Named in docs but no evidence found; existence unverified |
| `[RUNNING]` | Deployed / executed end-to-end at least once |
| `[SPEC]` | Specification exists but no running code evidenced |
| `[PARKED]` | Built or started, not currently active |
| `[EMPTY]` | Repo or file exists but contains only stubs / initial commit |

**Attribution:** everything in this document either cites a source file (path or `clean-build/...`) or is tagged with how the claim was derived. Anything unattributed is synthesis by me — challenge it.

## 0. One-paragraph summary

Amplified Partners is an AI-native business-advisory system for UK SMBs (£0–3M turnover), founded by Ewan Bramley. It has three arms: a **client-federation** (per-client on-site container + central federated database where cross-client Pudding discovery happens), an **AI-native Amplified-Partners arm** (marketing, client acquisition, the advisory surface itself), and a **Build-and-Test arm** (the factory that ships modules to the client containers). It runs on a Hetzner Beast (`135.181.161.131`) for compute-heavy inference, Railway for web services, and client sites for data sovereignty. The decomposition doctrine is APQC process taxonomy + BPMN/DMN + ISO 9001 with a D/H/A (Deterministic / Human / Agentic) triage for every task — every APQC Level-3 process is one shippable unit, buildable in parallel. The thesis is that "right model at right place with right information" can make an AI-native company possible at SMB scale. As of 2026-04-23, the factory (Byker) is running in production with a Qwen-32B / Llama-70B / Llama-8B trio, the vault holds ~4,500 markdown files, 16 repositories are active, a process-scaffold framework is named and drafted, and the federated client-side system is architected but not yet deployed.

Source for the diagram: Ewan's verbal architectural dump 2026-04-22 23:00→2026-04-23 03:30. `[CONFIRMED]` by Ewan naming each component on the drawn (unlabelled) diagram.

### 1.1 Arm 1 — AI-Native Amplified Partners

The revenue-facing and client-acquisition arm. What "Amplified Partners" publicly is.

- **Marketing suite** (see §3.2) `[SPEC; partial code]`
- **Sales & onboarding** — including the Interview Engine (7-phase → "Business Bible") `[KNOWLEDGE NOTE]`
- **Advisory delivery surface** — the thing the client actually uses day-to-day `[SPEC]`
- **Public site** — `amplified-website` repo (Next.js, Netlify) `[RUNNING]` / `amplified-site` repo (has `AMPLIFIED_OPERATING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md`, a 687-line unified spec) `[RUNNING — AUTHORITATIVE]`

### 1.2 Arm 2 — Build & Test (the factory)

The arm that builds the modules the client containers run.

- **Byker Production** — Qwen 32B Architect + Llama 70B Implementer + Llama 8B Validator, FastAPI on Railway, Ray Dalio Principles engine, Decision Log, Workflow engine, Obsidian integration. Live at `https://byker-production-production.up.railway.app/`. `[RUNNING]`
- **Clean-build workspace** — the governance spine. 1,091 files, 20MB. `00_authority/` for policy, `01_truth/` for processes/schemas/interfaces, `02_build/` for runnable artefacts, `03_shadow/` for experiments, `90_archive/` for provenance. Last commit 5 days ago (2026-04-18 "Add Constitution — Eight Laws, AMAS search, PUDDING math model"). `[RUNNING — AUTHORITATIVE]`
- **Research Pipe (Amplified Pudding Discovery System / APDS)** — five-stage pipeline (Intake → Interpreter → Curator1 → Search → Curator2) with Audit. Exists in three versioned forms in `~/ewan-mac/archive/` + `archive2/`. Uses Ollama Qwen locally + Claude + Exa + arXiv. `[RUNNING — partial; not continuously operated]`
- **Visual Polish System** — `visual-polish-system` repo, 5 days active. 10 aesthetic dimensions, UIClip + rubric composite score, hard-gate validation. `[RUNNING]`
- **Anthropic Token Proxy** — `anthropic-token-proxy` repo. Local prompt compression + prompt-injection detection layer. Reduces Anthropic spend. `[RUNNING]`
- **OpenClaw** — local agent-to-tool gateway. `openclaw` repo has COMMITMENT-SYSTEM, SHARED-BOARD, IDENTITY, SOUL, HEARTBEAT files. Session logs from 2026-04-18 and 2026-04-19 confirm daily active use. `[RUNNING]`
- **Vault** — `vault` repo, 4,682 files, 70MB. ~4,500 Obsidian markdown files. The "second brain". Vault-Sync daemon routes new work into it. `[RUNNING]`

### 1.3 Arm 3 — Client Federation

The delivery fabric. Not yet deployed, but architected.

- **Per-client containers** — on-site, data-resident, run HoundDog + CRM + P2 tokeniser. `[SPEC]` with `[DECISION REQUIRED]` on whether the container runs logic on-site or phones home
- **Federated central DB** — where tokenised data compounds, where Kaizen runs, where Pudding prospects across clients. `[SPEC]`
- **Integration strategy** — "pipe-in, not ARS integration" (Ewan, 2026-04-22). APIs disliked; data dumps preferred where possible. `[CONFIRMED intent; per-vertical scoping DECISION REQUIRED]`

## 2. The doctrine (how things are decomposed and built)

### 2.1 The process-scaffold framework

**Source:** `/home/ubuntu/ewan-docs/process-scaffold-framework.md` (603 lines) + `process-engineering-synthesis.md` (112 lines, 2026-04-18, "Ewan Bramley × Perplexity Computer / Claude Sonnet 4.6"). `[CONFIRMED]`

Three-standard stack:

| Layer | Standard | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| Taxonomy | APQC PCF v7.4.0 cross-industry (13 Level-1 categories, 5-level hierarchy) | *What* processes exist |
| Notation | BPMN 2.0 + DMN + CMMN (OMG Triple Crown) | *How* each process executes |
| Audit frame | ISO 9001:2015 (PDCA, required doc, continuous improvement) | *Why* it exists, how governed |

Plus **D/H/A triage** on every leaf task: Deterministic (runs as code), Human (judgement, not further decomposable), Agentic (fuzzy I/O, bounded).

**Output artefact:** one BPMN file per APQC Level-3 process. Level 4/5 are tasks inside the BPMN, not separate diagrams. Each task has named executor, D/H/A tag, SLA.

**Why this matters architecturally:** every APQC Level-3 process is a shippable unit. Different teams / sessions / arms can build different Level-3 processes in parallel because they share APQC numbering and D/H/A discipline but nothing else. This **is** the parallel-build thesis.

### 2.2 Clean-build "Eight Laws" (Constitution)

**Source:** `clean-build/00_authority/EIGHT_LAWS.md` (2026-04-18, v1.0 authoritative). Layer 0 immutable. `[CONFIRMED — AUTHORITATIVE]`

1. Don't Hurt Anyone (floor)
2. HR Is Absolute (AI does not do HR, ever)
3. No Telling People Off
4. *(laws 4-8 not yet read tonight; full read pending)* `[SOURCE REQUIRED — finish reading]`

### 2.3 SOUL principles

**Source:** `clean-build/00_authority/PRINCIPLES.md`. `[CONFIRMED — AUTHORITATIVE]`

Radical Honesty · Radical Transparency · Radical Attribution · Win-Win Only · Deterministic-First (90/10) · Congruence over Cleverness · Narrow Radius of Hand-off · Shadow-First for Curveballs · Privacy-First (no secrets in repo).

Plus the **cultural operands** Ewan named 2026-04-23:

- AI partnership is legally impossible but **functionally enforced** (held to same account)
- Idea meritocracy
- Not punitive; mistakes are signal
- Negative signals > positive signals for learning
- "Don't run agents at full pelt" — slack is mandatory

### 2.4 Agent orchestration architecture

**Named components:**

- **Units** — bounded work + documented handoff. Matches **Baton Pass Protocol** in `~/ewan-mac/archive2/pipe/BATON_PASS.md` + `BATON_PASS_v2.md`. `[CONFIRMED]`
- **Chain topology** — "exit shape fits entrance shape". Strict interface contract. Matches "narrow radius of hand-off" principle. `[CONFIRMED]`
- **Convergence topology** — 5→2→1 fan-in. Seen running in Byker (3-LLM trio → single validated output). Matches Pudding multi-lit → B-term synthesis. `[CONFIRMED in Byker]`
- **LLM-reviews-LLM** — Curator1 → Curator2 in research pipe; Implementer → Validator in Byker. `[CONFIRMED in both]`
- **Nature-logics vocabulary** — viral, bacterial, slime-mould, decentralized, hive-mind, mycelial — under evaluation as coordination-pattern language. `[UNDER EVALUATION]`
- **Triumvirate** — parallel Claude + Grok + Gemini consensus. Named in vault knowledge note. `[SOURCE REQUIRED — no code path traced yet]`
- **Cato** — enforcement logic for agent commitments. Named in vault. `[SOURCE REQUIRED]`
- **Sentinel** — drift/security monitoring. Named in vault. `[SOURCE REQUIRED]`

### 2.5 The Pudding Technique

**Source:** Don Swanson literature-based discovery (LBD). A-literature ↔ C-literature via B-term bridges. `[CONFIRMED external]`

**Ewan's application of it:**

- To research (APDS / research-pipe): multi-source literature synthesis.
- To **his own methodology** (2026-04-23): ISO 9001 (idea) → Perplexity collision → APQC + BPMN/DMN + D/H/A framework emerged. Pudding applied recursively.
- To cross-client intelligence: **"prospecting, not expecting"**. One client yields noise. N clients yield compounding cross-domain signal. Diversity of verticals > same-vertical scale.

`PUDDING-VALUE-MATHEMATICAL-MODEL-v1.md` and `PUDDING-CODE-SPECIFICATION-v1.docx` exist in `~/ewan-mac/archive4/`. `[SPEC]`

## 3. The products (what the business sells or plans to sell)

### 3.1 Bob — The Phone Answering Assistant

**Primary code:** `covered-ai-v2` repo, 349 files, 5.6MB, last meaningful commit 5 months ago. `[RUNNING but cold]`

**Scope:** AI phone answering system for UK service businesses. 24/7 availability. Captures caller intent, books callbacks, flags emergencies.

**Stack:** FastAPI, Deepgram `nova-2-phonecall`, Twilio WhatsApp, Postcodes.io, SQLite (WAL mode, outside iCloud path), Vapi for orchestration. `[CONFIRMED via known-issues docs in ~/ewan-mac/known-issues/]`

**Status flag:** "Dave-Ready" milestone — readiness for first plumbing-sector client. `[KNOWLEDGE NOTE; status unverified]`

### 3.2 The Marketing Suite (full-stack digital marketing)

**Source:** `amplified_conclusions_tonight.md` in `~/ewan-mac/archive4/`. `[CONFIRMED spec]`

Three tiers for SMBs:

| Tier | £/mo | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| Essential | £99–299 | 2 emails, 4 social posts, basic site, GBP |
| Professional | £500 | 4 emails, 8 social, 1 blog, full local SEO |
| Growth | £1,500 | 8 emails, 12 social, 2 blogs, full SEO+AIO, 2 videos/quarter |

**Margins:** 90%+ at 100 clients, ~£2.05/mo per-client cost. **Runs on Hetzner** (not sure which Hetzner — Beast or another box). HeyGen £19/mo for unlimited video.

**Implementation:** 14-agent marketing pipeline + Brand Guardian, named in `dept-marketing.md` (833 lines). Code evidence partial — `amplified-content` repo (inside ewan-dot, 85KB, 2026-02-12). `[SPEC with partial code]`

### 3.3 The Advisory Service (the "core" product)

The service that actually runs in a client's business, powered by the client container + central federated DB.

**Not yet built as code.** The `process-scaffold-framework.md` and the client-federation architecture are the blueprint. One BPMN file per Level-3 advisory process, D/H/A tagged, named executors. `[SPEC]`

**Mechanic:** blank-framework (APQC) × client-filled-framework → gap analysis → **delivery done quietly, without ego**. "We're not trying to change them." (Ewan, 2026-04-23). `[CONFIRMED product philosophy]`

### 3.4 Cove / Cove Code Factory

**Source:** `2026-04-17-amplified-partners-repo-assessment.md` lists a `cove` repo (25KB, 2026-03-13). Not in my on-disk clone. HoundDog integration plan lists "Cove Code Factory" as a touchpoint. `[SPEC / repo not visible]`

### 3.5 Nexus-v2 (70/30 hybrid investment system)

Not part of Amplified's SMB advisory mission. A separate Ewan project. `ewan-dot/nexus-v2` repo (70KB, 2026-03-14). `[PARKED — adjacent project]`

### 3.6 Fair-Start (digital toolkit for young people)

`ewan-dot/fair-start` repo (9KB, 2026-02-24). Mentioned in assessment. Not on my disk. `[SPEC — adjacent project]`

---

## 4. The infrastructure

### 4.1 The Beast (Hetzner AX162-R)

**Spec** (from `amplified-site/AMPLIFIED_OPERATING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` and the beast PDF):

- 48-core AMD EPYC, 256GB RAM, 10Gbit pipe
- Falkenstein, Germany (EU GDPR jurisdiction)
- IP: `135.181.161.131`

**Status** (probed 2026-04-22 tonight):

- SSH port 22 — open `[CONFIRMED]`
- HTTP port 80 — 301 redirect (likely → HTTPS) `[CONFIRMED]`
- Ollama port 11434 — **not externally reachable** (correct: local-first, LLM inference stays internal) `[CONFIRMED]`

**Roles:** heavy LLM inference, on-site-equivalent compute for internal work, the Compound Engineering factory's local runtime. `[CONFIRMED]`

### 4.2 Railway deployments

From code + URLs seen tonight:

| Service | Repo | URL |
|---|---|---|
| `byker-production-production` | `byker-production` | https://byker-production-production.up.railway.app/ |

- **FalkorDB** — graph database (HoundDog plan) `[SPEC]`
- **Graphiti** — graph memory over FalkorDB `[SPEC]`
- **PaddleOCR 3.0** — document OCR (HoundDog) `[SPEC]`

### 4.6 Security posture

- Shamir's Secret Sharing for key custody — `[CONFIRMED intent]`
- AWS/Amazon-style redundancy; claim uptime *below* actual (e.g. <99.8%) — `[CONFIRMED intent]`
- Isolated client-side architecture; only tokenised data crosses the wire — `[CONFIRMED intent]`
- P2 tokenisation scheme: strip names, truncate DOB to year, address to outcode (first part of UK postcode) — `[CONFIRMED]`
- Prompt-injection detection in `anthropic-token-proxy` — `[RUNNING]`

## 8. Open decisions (not recommendations — just the open questions)

These are the things that tonight's tour surfaced as unresolved. Not ranked. Not prioritised.

1. **Software-on-site vs cloud-hosted** for the client container.  
   *Ideal is full on-site data sovereignty. Pragmatic floor is tokenise-at-edge. Decision changes Beast's role significantly.* `[DECISION REQUIRED — needs tech lead]`

2. **APIs vs data dumps** for client-system integration.  
   *Per-vertical scoping needed. Plumbers (QuickBooks or none) ≠ enterprise (Salesforce/HubSpot/Xero). A one-week vertical scoping exercise before any three-month API department commitment.* `[DECISION REQUIRED]`

3. **Graph+vector DB strategy.**  
   *Start with SQL + recursive CTEs (viable up to ~10K edges), or go direct to FalkorDB/Qdrant? Verified tonight: SQL-with-graph is real, not bullshit.* `[DECISION REQUIRED]`

4. **First ship (which Level-3 process).**  
   *Bob (Handle Customer Contact)? Marketing Suite (Manage Sales Opportunities)? The advisory service itself?* `[DECISION REQUIRED — explicitly deferred tonight]`

5. **Repo reconciliation (22 vs 16).**  
   *Ghost, deleted, moved, or access-limited?* `[DECISION REQUIRED — low urgency]`

6. **Terminology resolution.**  
   *HoundDog vs "Desk Dog" — canonical? Triumvirate vs AI Board — same thing?* `[TERMINOLOGY TBC]`

7. **Amplified-Partners as a public brand vs Amplified-Partners as the holding arm.**  
   *Current: `amplified-website` says the first; the three-arm architecture says the second. Is "Amplified Partners" the consumer-facing brand or the internal holding company?* `[TERMINOLOGY TBC]`

8. **Eight Laws 4-8 content.**  
   *I only read 1-3 tonight. Need to finish.* `[DEVIN TODO]`

9. **Nature logics formalisation.**  
   *Six names; still under evaluation as coordination vocabulary.* `[UNDER EVALUATION]`

10. **Outputs/ folder from prior CE consolidation run.**  
    *If still accessible, would save rework and improve cross-session continuity.* `[NICE TO HAVE]`

---

## 9. Blanks I know about (things I expected but didn't find)

- **`workflows/brainstorm.md`** referenced in a Compound Engineering AGENTS.md but not present (per CE session log). Prior agent resolved by using upstream reference instead.
- **Contents of image.png** Ewan sent tonight — appeared to be a blank rounded rectangle. Later screenshot showed unlabelled boxes; labels supplied verbally.
- **Level-4 and Level-5** APQC decomposition in any of the specs. Only Level-1 through Level-3 evidenced.
- **One-page process register** (`amplified_process_register.xlsx`) — I have the filename but not a readable view of contents. `[SOURCE REQUIRED]`
- **API token map** — I know providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Exa, arXiv, Perplexity, Deepgram, Twilio, Vapi, Cartesia, Qdrant, etc.) but not which are in active use vs rotated vs dormant. `[SOURCE REQUIRED]`

## 10. Things Ewan said tonight that I've captured as operands (not flavour)

These are things a future agent reading this map should treat as instructions, not atmosphere:

1. "Prospecting, not expecting" — applied to Pudding at scale. Don't run expecting insight per client. Run to prospect across clients.
2. "Pipe-in, not integrate" — our CRM is the surface. No embedding in client ARS/legacy software.
3. "Don't run agents at full pelt" — slack mandatory. Capacity discipline.
4. "Exit shape fits entrance shape" — agent handoff is a strict interface contract.
5. "Right model at right place with right information" — routing is a first-class design element, not a later optimisation.
6. "Do it quietly, without ego" — advisory delivery does not involve telling the client they were wrong.
7. "We value mistakes as well as successes. More information from a negative signal than a positive signal." — negative-signal capture is not optional.
8. "Held to the same account" — AI-human partnership is culturally enforced even if legally impossible.
9. "I'm not the best one to run this company because I'm a lunatic" — architectural statement, not self-deprecation. Ewan = architect + final accountability. Operations are delegated.
10. "Claim a little bit less" — uptime promises are below actuals.
11. "Everything is P2 tokenised on-site in the container" — non-negotiable on the data boundary.
12. "I won't leave this alone. I'll go to another IDE and do it again." — the system itself is not allowed to be the blocker. Agents are exchangeable.

## 11. Meta — on the map itself

**What this map is synthesis from:**

- 16 on-disk repos at `/home/ubuntu/repos/`
- 5 zipped folders Ewan dropped tonight (Known Issues, 2× Archive, HoundDog plan, Library of ~284 docs)
- 3 OpenClaw session JSONL logs
- 1 Compound Engineering session log
- 2 framework docs (`process-scaffold-framework.md` + `process-engineering-synthesis.md`)
- 2 vault auto-generated knowledge notes (vault, visual-polish-system)
- ~5 hours of Ewan's verbal architectural narration 2026-04-22 evening → 2026-04-23 early morning

**What this map explicitly does not do:**

- Does not rank products by priority
- Does not recommend a first-ship decision
- Does not evaluate whether the architecture will work
- Does not re-design anything
- Does not commit anything to any repo

**Honest admissions about this map:**

- It is a first draft written in one sitting with Ewan's requirement to move to synthesis. Treat gaps as Devin-gaps, not Ewan-gaps.
- Anything marked `[SOURCE REQUIRED]` means I have a name and no evidence. That is a blank, not an absence.
- Some `[SPEC]` items may in fact be `[RUNNING]` — I didn't read every file of every repo tonight.
- The three-arm shape is my synthesis from Ewan's verbal narration. Ewan has not called it "three arms" in those words — he named the client federation + Amplified-Partners (AI-native) + Build-and-Test. "Three arms" is my framing.

**Next pass should:**

- Finish reading the Eight Laws (4-8)
- Read the 687-line `AMPLIFIED_OPERATING_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` end-to-end
- Resolve the outputs/ folder from the CE run
- Resolve the 22-vs-16 repo gap
- Read the amplified_process_register.xlsx contents

*End of map v0.1 DRAFT — awaiting Ewan's correction pass.*

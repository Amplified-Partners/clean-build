## 3. Public sources actually reached

All sources below returned 2xx during this validation run; raw responses are
cached under `02_build/validators/retail/cache/` with SHA-256 hashes
recorded in each verdict.

- **Police.uk crimes-street API** (`https://data.police.uk/api`) — 10 England+Wales retail anchor postcodes, March 2026 shoplifting incidents, street-level granularity. (Glasgow + Edinburgh excluded — Police Scotland is a separate organisation that does not publish to data.police.uk; the master `RETAIL_AREAS` list still includes them for use with non-Police.uk sources.)
- **ONS Beta API** (`https://api.beta.ons.gov.uk/v1`) — `cpih01` (CPI/CPIH), `retail-sales-index`, `retail-sales-index-all-businesses`, `uk-spending-on-cards`, family-spending categories.
- **Nomis** (`https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01`) — ASHE earnings dataset metadata.
- **DLUHC IMD 2019** (`https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019`) — LSOA-level deprivation index page reachable.
- **Land Registry CCOD service page** (`https://use-land-property-data.service.gov.uk/datasets/ccod`) — service page reachable; download link is gated and goes to follow-up.
- **GOV.UK content API** (`https://www.gov.uk/api/content/...`) — Insolvency Service release collection, school term dates, DESNZ sub-national energy collection, DfT maritime/port stats collection.
- **Bank of England** (`https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database`) — statistical database root reachable (FX leg).
- **Amazon Seller Central** (`https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/help/...`) — fee-schedule documentation page (HTML doc, not an API).

## 4. Key-gated sources (downgraded to PLAUSIBLE without keys)

| Source                  | Env var                       | Affected runners                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Companies House API     | `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY`     | INS-064, INS-070                  |
| Met Office DataPoint    | `MET_OFFICE_DATAPOINT_KEY`    | INS-060                           |
| EPC Open Data           | `EPC_API_AUTH`                | INS-071 (optional second leg)     |

Adding any key auto-upgrades the next run without code changes — runners read
keys lazily and downgrade rather than crash when keys are absent.

## 5. Held back by policy (`DEFERRED`)

- **INS-077** — Product-description scraping of Amazon/Etsy/Google Shopping
  competitor listings sits inside platform ToS + legal-review boundaries.
  Public-data validation is **not** attempted from automated sessions; the
  recipe is gated until Ewan + legal review approve a deployment context.

## 6. Reproducibility

```bash
# from repo root
PYTHONPATH=02_build python -m validators.retail.cli list
PYTHONPATH=02_build python -m validators.retail.cli run            # all 19
PYTHONPATH=02_build python -m validators.retail.cli run --ins INS-067
PYTHONPATH=02_build python -m validators.retail.cli summary        # table view
PYTHONPATH=02_build python -m validators.retail.cli ticket-comment # markdown summary
```

Re-running with cached responses is deterministic; deleting
`02_build/validators/retail/cache/` triggers a clean re-fetch. Each verdict
records the git SHA at run time so downstream pipelines can pin to a specific
commit.

## 8. Changelog

- v1 (2026-05-03, Devon-9a6b) — initial rollup; 8 PROVEN / 10 PLAUSIBLE / 1 DEFERRED.
- v2 (2026-05-03, Devon-9a6b) — Devin Review fixes:
  - INS-067: distribution-test `z_min` corrected from 0.5 to 1.0 to match the schema default and the runner's own docstring; verdict downgrades to PLAUSIBLE (z=0.93 < 1.0).
  - INS-069: substring-match heuristic on ONS Beta search results was inflating to PROVEN against unrelated tax/benefits dataset; replaced with a publication-route check against the canonical Family Spending Workbook 1 page (still PROVEN, but on a real signal).
  - Headline counts updated: 7 PROVEN / 11 PLAUSIBLE / 1 DEFERRED.
- v3 (2026-05-03, Devon-9a6b) — Devin Review fix:
  - INS-065: ASHE detection heuristic was assuming Nomis SDMX `name` was a string. The Nomis API actually returns it as a dict (`{"value": "annual survey of hours and earnings - workplace analysis", "lang": "en"}`), so the substring match always failed and the runner fell through to PLAUSIBLE. Fixed to handle dict shape, list-of-dicts shape, AND annotations (`Mnemonic` / `contenttype/sources` carry the canonical `ashe` tag). Verdict upgrades to PROVEN (conf 88).
  - Headline counts updated: 8 PROVEN / 10 PLAUSIBLE / 1 DEFERRED.
- v4 (2026-05-03, Devon-9a6b) — Devin Review fix:
  - INS-067: Police.uk anchor list silently included Glasgow (G1) and Edinburgh (EH1). Police.uk only covers the 43 territorial forces in England + Wales — Police Scotland is a separate organisation that does not publish to data.police.uk, so those two anchors always returned `[]`. The two structural zeros pulled the distribution mean from 184.2 down to 153.5 and inflated stdev, dropping z below the 1.0 threshold and producing a spurious PLAUSIBLE. Split `RETAIL_AREAS` into a canonical master list (still includes Scotland for use with non-Police.uk sources) and a `RETAIL_AREAS_POLICE_UK` England+Wales subset; INS-067 now uses the latter. New result: n=10, mean=184.2, σ=158.2, z=1.13 ≥ 1.0 → PROVEN (conf 88). Manchester returns 0 in March 2026 (Greater Manchester Police data lag, not a coverage gap) and is kept — it's real signal, not noise.
  - Headline counts updated: 9 PROVEN / 9 PLAUSIBLE / 1 DEFERRED.
- v5 (2026-05-03, Devon-9a6b) — Devin Review framework fix:
  - `existence_check` was silently accepting partial coverage as PROVEN when `require_all=False` (the default). The function computed `n_failed` and put it in the bundle but never used it to gate the verdict, so a runner that queried two sources and got back one 200 + one 404 would land at PROVEN with the misleading reason "all 1 sources reachable". Added a `len(failed) > 0` PLAUSIBLE branch with reason `"{N} source(s) failed — partial validation"`; added five unit tests in `02_build/validators/retail/tests/test_existence.py` covering all branches.
  - Cascading effect: INS-062 was the only insight that exhibited the symptom (cpih01 200, cpi01 404). It now correctly downgrades to PLAUSIBLE (conf 70). The runner queried both `cpih01` (the canonical CPIH dataset, which IS reachable) and `cpi01` (which is not currently published on the ONS Beta v1 API) — the cpih01 leg alone supports the recipe, but the runner did not encode that knowledge, so the framework correctly reports partial coverage. Cleaning up the runner to query only `cpih01` is left for a follow-up so this commit is purely the framework fix + the honest downgrade.
  - Headline counts updated: 8 PROVEN / 10 PLAUSIBLE / 1 DEFERRED.

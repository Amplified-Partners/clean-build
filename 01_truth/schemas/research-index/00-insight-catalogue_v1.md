## TOP 10 "ONE-PAGER" INSIGHTS (30-second client understanding)

| Rank | ID | One-Liner |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | INS-003 | "You're paying 10 engineers for 8 hours but only billing 5.5 — that gap is worth £180k–£375k." |
| 2 | INS-027 | "14% of your bookings are ghosts. A deposit policy and 24h SMS cuts that in half and recovers £18k–£25k/year." |
| 3 | INS-006 | "Every house sold in your postcode is a customer within 60 days. Land Registry tells you who they are for free." |
| 4 | INS-037 | "Your menu has Stars making money and Dogs losing it. PLU data tells you which is which in an afternoon." |
| 5 | INS-085 | "That client with a rising WIP balance just filed accounts with negative equity. Stop billing and start collecting." |
| 6 | INS-022 | "A competitor who files accounts 3 months late is probably insolvent. Companies House tells you today; the gazette tells you too late." |
| 7 | INS-002 | "Copper rose 19% last year. Your quote template hasn't changed. You're losing 5–8% margin on every materials job." |
| 8 | INS-018 | "71% of Newcastle homes have an EPC. The ones rated D or below — with gas boilers — are your next boiler replacement customers. The list is free." |
| 9 | INS-076 | "When the competitor down the road misses their Companies House filing deadline, their customers are about to become available. Set an alert." |
| 10 | INS-134 | "A client whose emails get shorter every week is about to leave. The pattern fires 8 weeks before the cancellation email arrives." |

## TRADES VERTICAL (INS-001 to INS-035)

---

**ID:** INS-001
**TITLE:** Emergency Call Demand Forecasting
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Phone CDRs (inbound call volume, emergency job flags); job tickets (emergency type, timestamp); on-call rota
**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office MIDAS Open Dataset (daily temperature, rainfall); Environment Agency Flood Monitoring API (real-time flood warnings); ONS housing age data by postcode sector
**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress historical emergency call volume against daily minimum temperature, rainfall intensity, active flood alerts, and weighted housing stock age score by postcode; fit Erlang C model to translate predicted volume into required staffing; output rolling 48-hour forward demand score
**INSIGHT:** Predict emergency call surge 48 hours ahead within ±15–20% accuracy; Victorian/Edwardian terracing in NE1–NE3 is highest burst-pipe risk when temperature drops below 0°C
**ACTION:** Pre-position one additional on-call engineer when forecast score exceeds threshold; pre-order copper fittings and lagging materials; pre-authorise overtime
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£80,000/yr (15–20% revenue capture improvement during surges, 25–35% SLA breach reduction)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Erlang C (telephony queueing); Little's Law; Deming SPC (forecast residual monitoring)
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.>.3.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Met Office temperature → NHS A&E admission patterns → same temperature event drives burst pipes and boiler failures → Monday-morning cold snap fills both A&E and Jesmond Plumbing's voicemail from the same causal chain: T < 0°C → pipes freeze → fracture on rise → emergency call 6–18 hours later

**ID:** INS-002
**TITLE:** Supplier Price Death-Spiral Detection
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Merchant PO line-item data (Wolseley/City Plumbing exports); job costing records (materials cost per job); historical quote templates
**PUBLIC DATA:** Bank of England Producer Price Index (copper tubes and fittings); LME Copper spot price API; ONS Construction Materials Price Index (pipes and fittings sub-index)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Index price paid per unit from merchant invoices against ONS PPI sub-index per materials category; compute "quote-margin shadow" — difference between margin assumed in template and market-adjusted margin; flag when shadow exceeds actual by >2 standard deviations (SPC Western Electric rules)
**INSIGHT:** Detect margin erosion before it appears in P&L; pipes and fittings rose 19.3% YoY to April 2024 — a firm using January 2024 template prices in April 2024 was losing 5–8% gross margin per job unknowingly
**ACTION:** Auto-rebase quote templates when materials index exceeds threshold; pass through surcharges on open quotes; flag fixed-materials-price contracts for renegotiation
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £45,000–£105,000/yr (3–7% gross margin recovery on £1.5m revenue)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z-score (retained earnings fragility signal); Deming SPC (Western Electric rules for drift); Porter Value Chain
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.-.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** LME copper futures (USD-traded) → BoE PPI published 3–5 week lag → Wolseley invoice 2–4 week further delay → your static quote template. Forward signal is LME copper, not the Wolseley statement — the data is 6–9 weeks ahead of the price you're currently using

**TITLE:** Engineer Utilisation Optimisation Engine
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** FSM job records (scheduled vs actual start/end); engineer timesheets; van telematics GPS tracks; payroll hours
**PUBLIC DATA:** Google Maps Distance Matrix API (travel time between jobs); ONS postcode-to-LSOA lookup (geographic clustering); RAC/AA average UK traffic speed data by time-of-day
**FUSION LOGIC:** Reconstruct each engineer's day from GPS + job records: billable time, travel time, idle time, admin time; compute utilisation = billable hours / total paid hours; cross-reference with optimal routing using Maps API distance matrix; quantify routing inefficiency as wasted van-hours per day
**INSIGHT:** Average unoptimised trades firm runs 55–65% utilisation; every percentage point recovered on a 10-engineer firm = ~£18,000–£25,000 margin; routing sub-optimality adds 25–40 minutes non-billable travel per engineer per day
**ACTION:** Shift to GPS-informed job scheduling (Commusoft/simPRO map-based scheduling); cluster jobs by postcode sector; book follow-up jobs in same geographic area as primary
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £180,000–£375,000/yr (10–15 percentage point utilisation improvement, 10-engineer firm at £65/hr)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Goldratt Theory of Constraints (billable hour is system throughput constraint); Travelling Salesman Problem heuristics; Deming PDCA
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.>.3.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Military logistics (vehicle routing for supply convoys in Iraq/Afghanistan) → Amazon last-mile delivery optimisation → Commusoft scheduling → your plumber's daily route. The same mathematical infrastructure is available via free APIs

**ID:** INS-004
**TITLE:** Customer No-Show Prediction Model (Trades)
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical job bookings with outcome (attended / no-show / cancelled); customer record (residential/commercial, new/repeat, booking channel, time of booking); weather at job time; day-of-week
**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office 5-day temperature forecast; ONS Indices of Multiple Deprivation by postcode; Bank of England base rate history (cost-of-living pressure proxy)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Logistic regression trained on historical job outcomes; features include booking channel, customer type, job type, day-of-week, days-since-booking, postcode IMD decile, day-of-month (benefit payment dates cluster around 1st/15th); predict no-show probability at booking time
**INSIGHT:** High-probability no-shows (>30% predicted risk) can be triaged for automated confirmation SMS 24h prior, phone call 2h prior — reduces no-show rate by 40–60% in the high-risk cohort; industry-wide plumbing no-shows run 8–15%
**ACTION:** Two-tier confirmation workflow: standard email for <15% risk; SMS + call for >15% risk; for >40% risk, require upfront deposit via Stripe card-on-file
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £13,500–£30,000/yr (reducing no-show from 12% to 7% on 1,500 jobs/yr saves 75 slots × £180 average)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Logistic regression (Bayesian); Little's Law; revenue management (airline yield management applied to field service)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.>.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Hotel overbooking optimisation (industry solved no-shows via deposits in the 1970s) → airline yield management → ride-hailing surge pricing → trades SMB confirmation workflow. The plumber's no-show is solved by the same insight as the hotel's empty room

**TITLE:** Merchant Rebate Leakage Recovery
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Merchant account statements (Wolseley, City Plumbing, Edmundson) — monthly totals by category; FSM job records (materials used per job type)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Wolseley published trade account rebate tier thresholds; ONS construction output seasonality index (to normalise seasonal spend patterns)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Map cumulative spend by category against rebate tier thresholds; flag when within 15% of tier boundary at any point in quarter; simulate spend-forward to compute expected rebate value vs cost of pre-ordering (carrying cost × capital cost × storage)
**INSIGHT:** Most SMBs on trade account rebate schemes claim 60–80% of available rebates; average under-claim for a firm with £150k annual merchant spend is £1,500–£4,000/yr
**ACTION:** Monthly rebate dashboard; pre-order trigger when within 15% of tier boundary and carrying cost < rebate value; renegotiate tier structure annually with account manager using spend data as leverage
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,750–£6,000/yr (full rebate capture at 2.5–4% on £150k annual merchant spend; zero implementation cost)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Supply chain finance (JIT vs safety stock); Activity-Based Costing (attributing true materials cost including missed rebates)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.1.p
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Tesco Clubcard spend-to-tier algorithms → airline frequent flyer tier management → Wolseley trade account rebate architecture.

**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Job records by job type (bathroom refit, heating upgrade, rewire), customer address, job date
**PUBLIC DATA:** HM Land Registry Price Paid Data (all residential property transactions in England and Wales, updated monthly, free); EPC lodgement data from DLUHC (new EPCs indicate property changes)
**FUSION LOGIC:** For served postcodes, download monthly Land Registry transactions; compute number of residential sales in past 90 days by postcode; cross-reference with historical average days from sale to first refurbishment instruction; build forward pipeline of recently sold properties with no job recorded — prime outbound marketing window
**INSIGHT:** Properties sell and within 45–90 days, 60–70% undergo some plumbing, electrical, or heating work; Land Registry data is a 45-day leading indicator of residential refurbishment demand
**ACTION:** Monthly "hot list" of recently sold properties in served postcodes; targeted direct mail or door-drop offering free boiler health check or electrical inspection; new owner safety anxiety is highest in first 60 days
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £33,600–£42,000/yr ongoing (8–10 new customers/month × £350 average first job + lifetime boiler service × 10 years at £120/yr)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modelling; market-of-one personalisation (Pine & Gilmore); propensity-to-buy scoring

**TITLE:** Planning Application Leading Indicator — Refurbishment / Extension Demand
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical job records (extension plumbing, loft conversion electrical, kitchen refit heating); job lead time from enquiry to instruction
**PUBLIC DATA:** Planning.data.gov.uk API (100+ planning and housing datasets for England); UK PlanIt (19.9M planning applications, searchable by postcode/type); Planning Portal (application volume data)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Automated weekly pull from Planning.data.gov.uk API for served local authority; filter for loft conversions, single-storey extensions, kitchen extensions, garage conversions, full refurbishment permissions — a 3–6 month leading indicator of trades demand; cross-reference with firm's historical highest-margin job types
**INSIGHT:** A planning approval in NE2 for a rear extension has 70% probability of becoming a future instruction for replumbing, rewiring, and underfloor heating within 6 months
**ACTION:** Weekly "new approvals" digest; sales outreach to planning applicants (contact details on application — public record) offering quote for associated trades work; prioritise high-value application types (full refurb > single extension > loft)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £120,000/yr (capturing 3% of relevant planning applications: ~100 jobs × £1,200 average)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Lead scoring (HubSpot/Salesforce methodology on public data); pull marketing (data-driven demand generation)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.5.m

**TITLE:** New Build First-Fix Demand Forecasting
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical new-build first-fix job records (plumbing rough-in, electrical first fix); job value; lead time from developer enquiry to start
**PUBLIC DATA:** NHBC new home registrations data (quarterly by region — North East saw +78% Q3 2024 vs Q3 2023); DLUHC housing supply indicators (quarterly starts and completions by region); EPC new dwelling lodgements by region
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build 12-month forward model of new-build completions from NHBC registration data (registrations → completions with 12–18 month lag); estimate first-fix demand as proportion of completions; cross-reference with existing developer relationships in job records
**INSIGHT:** North East new home registrations grew 78% in Q3 2024; predictable first-fix demand surge 12–18 months later (Q1–Q3 2026); firms without developer relationships now will miss this window
**ACTION:** Proactive developer outreach based on NHBC-identified active sites; quote in advance of ground-break; consider hiring one first-fix specialist apprentice 9 months ahead of demand surge
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £50,000/contract (one 20-unit development first-fix: 20 units × £2,500 at 25–30% margin)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Demand forecasting (S&OP); Goldratt TOC buffer management; NHBC data as published leading indicator

**TITLE:** Newcastle Student Rental Cycle → Seasonal Demand Signal
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical job records tagged by property type (HMO/student let vs owner-occupied); job type, date, postcode; call volume time series
**PUBLIC DATA:** Newcastle/Northumbria University academic calendar (publicly published); Newcastle lettings market data (42,000+ students, peak turnover June/September); Newcastle HMO licensing register (council — publicly available)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Tag every job in Jesmond/Sandyford/Heaton (NE2/NE1/NE6) as likely student-let using HMO property type lookup; build month-by-month demand profile by job type; identify peak demand windows around tenancy changeovers (late May/June and late August/September)
**INSIGHT:** A firm serving Jesmond and Sandyford sees 30–45% of its residential reactive work cluster into 8 weeks of the year around tenancy changeovers; without visibility, the firm under-resources these periods and over-resources the summer trough
**ACTION:** Seasonal capacity plan keyed to academic calendar; pre-sell landlord "end-of-tenancy packs" (boiler service + CP12 + EICR bundle) in April for June delivery; hire seasonal labour for June and August peaks
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £40,000–£80,000/yr additional revenue during peak windows from pre-sold bundles and seasonal staffing
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Revenue management (yield optimisation); seasonal capacity planning (RM Yield from hospitality); customer bundling (increases LTV and switching cost)
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.~.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Newcastle hotels peak in September for Freshers' Week, October for Great North Run → student rental market peaks at same time → landlord trades demand peaks at same time. All three industries share the same seasonal driver; only hospitality has historically planned for it

**TITLE:** Checkatrade Review Velocity → Revenue Forecaster (Trades)
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Job completion records (date, customer, job type, value); existing Checkatrade profile reviews (date, score, text)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Checkatrade.com public review data (review date, score, category); competitor Checkatrade profiles for comparable Newcastle firms; Trustpilot for cross-platform sentiment
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build time-series of review velocity (reviews/month) and average score; correlate review velocity with revenue 30–60 days later (lag); for competitors, track review velocity as proxy for demand and capacity — competitor whose reviews drop 8/month to 2/month is likely capacity-constrained (competitive opportunity)
**INSIGHT:** A 50% drop in review velocity predicts a 15–25% revenue decline 6 weeks later; for competitors, sustained velocity decline signals market share opportunity
**ACTION:** Build automated post-job review request into completion workflow (Commusoft natively supports); monitor competitor velocity monthly; when competitor velocity drops >30%, deploy targeted local Google Ads in their postcode area
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£70,000/yr (20–35% increase in inbound enquiry conversion from Checkatrade by lifting review velocity from 4/month to 10/month)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Net Promoter Score (Reichheld) as operational metric; social proof theory (Cialdini); Porter Five Forces (rivalry intensity)

**TITLE:** Competitor Death-Spiral Signal from Companies House (Trades)
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Competitor
**INTERNAL DATA:** List of known local competitors (Companies House numbers); firm's own quote-loss records; geographic service area postcodes
**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House free API (accounts filing status, filing dates, charges registered, director changes, dissolution notices); Insolvency Service Gazette (winding-up petitions, administration notices — free search)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor top 10–15 local competitor firms: (a) accounts filing timeliness (late = financial stress); (b) charges registered (new debentures = borrowing under pressure); (c) director resignations (key departure = succession or crisis); (d) Insolvency Gazette monitoring. Build composite "distress score" per competitor
**INSIGHT:** Construction insolvencies hit 3,950 in 12 months to January 2026; a competitor in distress creates 6–12 month window where their customers are seeking a new supplier and engineers are job-seeking
**ACTION:** When competitor distress score crosses threshold: targeted marketing to their customer postcode areas; proactive engineer recruitment outreach; readiness to absorb maintenance contract transfers
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £60,000/yr recurring (capturing 20% of a mid-sized competitor's customer base: 200 customers × £300 average annual maintenance contract)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z-Score (financial distress prediction); competitive intelligence; Porter Five Forces (rivalry, new entrants)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.1.i

**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Telematics GPS tracks (Samsara/Quartix); Allstar fuel card transactions (litres, pence-per-litre, station location); job postcode sequence; daily mileage
**PUBLIC DATA:** BEIS/DESNZ weekly fuel prices (national average petrol/diesel pump prices, updated weekly); RAC Fuel Watch data (regional price variation); Google Maps Traffic Flow API (optimal routing by time-of-day)
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each vehicle: compute actual fuel cost per mile from Allstar data; compare against BEIS national average; where pence-per-litre paid >5% above national average, identify station and suggest alternatives on route; compute optimal daily job sequence using Maps API distance matrix to minimise mileage
**INSIGHT:** Unoptimised routing adds 15–25% excess mileage; at £1.50/litre diesel and 30mpg (van), 5,000 excess miles/yr/vehicle costs £1,100 in fuel plus proportional tyre and maintenance wear
**ACTION:** Weekly route briefing for engineers based on optimal sequence; station recommendation when route passes a cheaper forecourt; bulk purchase at lowest-cost local station on high-volume days
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £13,500/yr (10-van fleet: £1,100/van fuel + £250 tyre/maintenance per van)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Operations research (vehicle routing problem); Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fleet modelling

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Consumer Price Index energy component (customer cost-of-living pressure proxy); Bank of England base rate (mortgage rate proxy); MHCLG English Housing Survey (housing type and tenure by local authority)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build "churn risk score" per contract using: (a) days since last PPM visit; (b) contract value vs call-outs used (underutilisation = lower perceived value); (c) payment record; (d) CPI energy trend; (e) local BoE base rate impact on mortgage payments; train logistic regression on historical renewals/cancellations
**INSIGHT:** 12–16 weeks before contract renewal is optimal intervention window; a churn risk score >40% triggers proactive retention; reducing churn from 18% to 12% on a £200,000 contract book preserves £12,000/yr recurring
**ACTION:** Monthly churn risk report; engineer relationship calls for high-risk contracts; free "contract health check" visit 3 months before renewal for accounts scoring >50%
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £60,000 NPV (£12,000/yr recurring × 5× LTV multiplier)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress firm's insurance-referred job volume against ABI published claim frequency by type (escape of water, storm damage) and Met Office seasonal conditions; overlay seasonal outlook to produce 90-day forward insurance referral forecast
**INSIGHT:** Insurance-referred work peaks sharply in Q1 (freeze/burst pipe season) and after major storm events; firms with pre-established loss assessor relationships capture this work systematically
**ACTION:** Proactive engagement with top 3 local loss assessors in October (pre-season); pre-position capacity on insurance panel lists; dedicated "insurance job" response protocol (faster SLA, better documentation) to drive repeat referrals
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £150,000/yr incremental (converting from 10% to 20% insurance revenue share on £1.5m turnover)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Gas Safe Register public statistics (annual publication of unsafe gas fittings by fault type and region); manufacturer recall databases (MHCLG/Gas Safe publish recall notices); Trading Standards product recall notices
**FUSION LOGIC:** Cross-reference callback jobs with: (a) specific part SKUs in original job (elevated failure rate by batch); (b) engineer on original job (engineer-level defect rate); (c) job type (different expected callback rates); (d) Gas Safe/manufacturer recall notices; build SPC control chart on callback rate by engineer per month — any engineer >2σ above team mean triggers quality review
**INSIGHT:** In most trades SMBs, 20% of engineers generate 60–80% of callbacks (Pareto); a specific boiler model or part batch may have elevated failure rate invisible without SKU-level matching
**ACTION:** Engineer-level quality dashboard; monthly materials quality review; proactive outreach to customers when recall identified for their fitted appliance (positive touch before they discover the fault)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £7,200/yr direct saving (reducing callback rate from 8% to 4%: 60 fewer callbacks × £120 average cost) + reputational value
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Gas Safe Register public search (verify engineer registration status by number — public tool); NICEIC contractor finder (verify contractor approval status); CITB CSCS card checker (public)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build rolling 180-day certification expiry calendar; flag any engineer with certification expiring within 60 days (action required), 30 days (urgent), or expired (operational risk); cross-reference with job types assigned to that engineer; use public Gas Safe search to audit actual registration status vs internal records
**INSIGHT:** A firm that discovers a Gas Safe card has lapsed the day before a boiler installation faces either breaking the law or cancelling a job; the public Gas Safe register provides an independent verification layer; engineers with more current CPD generate 30–50% fewer warranty callbacks
**ACTION:** Automated 90/60/30-day email/SMS reminders to engineer and manager; block scheduling of gas work for engineers within 45 days of expiry unless renewal confirmed; monthly external verification against Gas Safe public register
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000+ avoided (preventing one compliance incident: HSE enforcement up to £20,000 for unlicensed gas work + reputational and contract loss)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Model apprentice ROI curve: monthly cost vs monthly billable contribution; plot "break-even month" (typically month 18–24 of 4-year plumbing apprenticeship); model attrition risk from supervisor rating trend, college attendance rate, months since last milestone; flag at-risk apprentices 3 months before likely dropout
**INSIGHT:** UK construction apprenticeship achievement rate is 53% overall; half of apprentices started do not complete; dropout cost is typically £8,000–£15,000 per lost apprentice; early intervention reduces attrition by 30–40%
**ACTION:** Monthly apprentice progress dashboard; structured check-in at months 6, 12, 18; CITB grant claiming calendar; post-qualification retention plan built into model at month 42
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £52,000–£80,000 per retained apprentice (£40k–£60k first-year billable output + £12k–£20k avoided recruitment cost)

**FUSION LOGIC:** For served postcodes, download EPC records for properties with: (a) gas boiler as primary heating AND (b) EPC rating D or below AND (c) property age pre-1990; build "upgrade readiness score" factoring EPC score, property age, and whether property has previously had an EPC (indicating transaction activity); exclude properties already in job records
**INSIGHT:** 71% of English residential dwellings have an EPC lodged; significant proportion of pre-1970 housing in NE2/NE3 is EPC D or below; MEES regulations creating forced upgrade demand wave; government 2030 deadline for rental properties to reach EPC C
**ACTION:** Monthly "upgrade propensity" lead list by postcode; targeted leaflet/Google Ads in high-density D-rated postcode sectors; offer free "boiler health check and efficiency report" as low-cost entry generating paid upgrade work
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £560,000–£840,000 pipeline over 2–3 years (1% capture of EPC D-rated NE2/NE3 properties: 200–300 properties × £2,800 average boiler installation)

**PUBLIC DATA:** HMRC MTD ITSA rollout schedule (sole traders >£50k from April 2026, >£30k from April 2027); HMRC CIS guidance; HMRC late filing penalty data
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build compliance readiness score: (a) MTD-compatible accounting software; (b) CIS returns filed by 19th of month (on-time record); (c) VAT returns on schedule; (d) self-assessment returns before January deadline; firms with >2 late filings in past 24 months are at higher MTD non-compliance risk; cross-reference with Companies House accounts filing timeliness
**INSIGHT:** HMRC enforces MTD ITSA from April 2026 for sole traders above £50k; a trades sole trader who has not digitised records will face penalties of £200–£400/quarter; this is also an Amplified Partners engagement trigger — MTD compliance is the opening conversation for digital transformation
**ACTION:** Compliance audit of current accounting and tax filing infrastructure; MTD readiness plan; if paper-based, immediate transition to Xero or equivalent; use MTD deadline as client acquisition driver: "we help you get MTD-ready, and while we're in your data, we find £X in margin improvement"

**PUBLIC DATA:** DWP Cold Weather Payment trigger records (payments when temperature ≤0°C for 7 consecutive days, published by postcode area); Met Office synoptic temperature archive; National Grid ESO Demand Forecasts (gas demand by day — proxy for heating demand across the network)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Cross-reference dates when Cold Weather Payments were triggered in Newcastle DWP postcode area against firm's emergency call volume; build correlation matrix: trigger date → lag to emergency call peak (typically 48–72h for pipe burst; 24–48h for boiler failure); use National Grid gas demand data as real-time proxy for heating demand pressure
**INSIGHT:** Cold Weather Payment trigger events are a publicly announced signal that severe heating demand is imminent; in 2024–25 winter, cold weather payment triggers were issued to approximately 1.5 million households across multiple events
**ACTION:** Set up automated DWP Cold Weather Payment monitoring; when triggered: activate emergency on-call protocol, send pre-emptive SMS to maintenance contract customers, pre-order freeze-risk parts
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £9,000–£13,400/yr (reducing missed emergency calls during cold snaps by 20%: capturing 8 more per cold event × £280 average emergency revenue × 4–6 events/winter)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Google Trends (search demand for "plumber Jesmond", "emergency plumber Newcastle" — competitive intensity by month); Checkatrade/Rated People pricing data (public average pricing by job type, Newcastle area); ONS Household Disposable Income data (purchasing power by local authority)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Segment all quotes by job type × value band × customer type × channel source; compute win rate and average margin by segment cell; cross-reference with Google Trends search intensity (higher volume = higher urgency = lower price sensitivity = higher win rate); identify segments where win rate is below 25% despite good margin vs segments where win rate is above 50% (pricing power)
**INSIGHT:** Most trades SMBs win emergency work at >60% conversion but planned installation at <20%; optimal strategy: use emergency work as loss-leader to build relationships converting to high-margin planned work
**ACTION:** Differential pricing strategy by segment; increase pricing on emergency work (demand inelastic); sharpen pricing on planned installation quotes (competitive); reduce follow-up lag from 48h to 4h on high-value planned quotes (speed is primary conversion driver)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £25,000+ NPV per 5 percentage point improvement in win rate on planned work (10 additional jobs × £1,400 at 25% margin, compounded over 5 years with customer LTV)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Track monthly quote volume and win rate by segment; flag sustained 5+ percentage point decline in win rate on planned work over 3+ consecutive months
**INSIGHT:** Sustained win rate decline precedes revenue decline by 6–9 months (the pipeline-to-revenue lag); this is either price uncompetitiveness or proposal quality deterioration
**ACTION:** Diagnose cause (pricing vs pitch) using INS-021 segmentation; immediate quote template and follow-up protocol review
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £50,000–£200,000 protected (preventing revenue decline on a £1.5m business)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Sales pipeline analysis; leading indicator econometrics

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Compute total billable hours / total paid hours as rolling 4-week utilisation rate; flag when below 65%; at <60%, firm is likely loss-making at contribution level before overhead
**INSIGHT:** At sub-65% utilisation, engineers are being paid for non-billable time at a rate that cannot be sustained; at <60%, the firm cannot cover fixed costs
**ACTION:** Immediate utilisation audit (INS-003 activation); identify capacity vs demand imbalance; consider reducing fixed-cost headcount before cash reserves deplete
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £50,000+ protected (preventing terminal cash drain in a 10-engineer firm)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor for any unilateral term reduction by key supplier (Wolseley, City Plumbing); flag immediately; any supplier balance >60 days outstanding >£5,000 is a concurrent trigger
**INSIGHT:** When a merchant moves from 60-day to 30-day or proforma terms, their credit team has assessed the firm as higher risk; this is among the most reliable distress signals — the merchant knows the firm's payment behaviour before the firm's own bank does
**ACTION:** Immediate cash position review; collections acceleration; emergency credit facility assessment before the bank is notified

**INTERNAL DATA:** HMRC GPS confirmation letter; VAT and CIS filing records; payroll RTI data
**PUBLIC DATA:** HMRC CIS register (GPS suspensions); HMRC published enforcement data
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor HMRC GPS confirmation; cross-reference CIS monthly return filing timeliness and payment records; GPS loss occurs when contractor misses tax payments or fails to file returns
**INSIGHT:** GPS loss means immediate 20–30% deduction at source on all subcontract payments — a catastrophic cashflow shock with no warning period; this is a terminal distress indicator
**ACTION:** Immediate HMRC engagement; Time to Pay Arrangement application; cash reserves assessment; GPS restoration application timeline (typically 3 months minimum)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** Potentially £50,000–£150,000 cashflow impact prevention
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)

**INSIGHT:** A divergence where inbound calls decline but quotes remain constant signals that the firm is creating activity without creating revenue — engineers filling time with poorer-quality leads or padding quotes
**ACTION:** Call quality audit; review of which job types are being quoted vs historical mix; price sensitivity analysis by lead source
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£100,000 protected (preventing revenue quality deterioration before it reaches P&L)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Sales funnel analysis; leading indicator econometrics; Forrester reinforcing loops

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each completed job, extract customer sentiment from nearest available text channel; apply Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA using RoBERTa fine-tuned on service-industry reviews) to decompose sentiment into quality, professionalism, punctuality, communication, and value; assign to engineer; normalise against job-type baseline; build rolling 13-week engineer-level profile per dimension
**INSIGHT:** Identifies which engineers consistently produce happier customers independent of job difficulty; separates technically competent but sentiment-negative engineers (poor communicator, messy) from those with strong interpersonal scores; signal precedes formal complaints or review scores by 4–8 weeks
**ACTION:** Monthly engineer sentiment dashboard; pair low-sentiment engineers with high-sentiment mentors on complex jobs; use profiles in appraisals as coaching prompt; assign high-sentiment engineers to new customer first impressions and contract renewal visits
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £4,500–£6,000/yr retained contract revenue (1.5–2 maintenance contract renewals per quarter per coached engineer × £300/yr average contract)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply BERTopic unsupervised topic modelling to rolling 24-month review corpus, refitted monthly on 90-day sliding window; for each month compute topic distribution; track month-on-month shift in topic proportions; flag any topic increasing >15pp over two consecutive months; cross-reference with operational changes in that period and subsequent score drops
**INSIGHT:** Review scores are a lagging indicator; topic drift in review language is a leading indicator — customers begin mentioning "had to chase" or "took longer than expected" in positive reviews before those themes cause a score to drop; pattern fires 6–14 weeks before rating movement
**ACTION:** Monthly topic drift report; when "responsiveness" topic rises, investigate scheduling; when "parts/materials" topic rises, investigate supplier reliability and van stock
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £36,000/yr protected (0.3-star review score drop avoided × 10–12% inbound enquiry reduction × £300,000 Checkatrade-sourced revenue on £1.5m business)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply three-class text classifier (fine-tuned DistilBERT or zero-shot Llama 3.1 8B) to classify rejection language: (a) Price signal ("bit expensive", "found someone cheaper"); (b) Trust signal ("not sure about the work described", "going with someone we know"); (c) Speed signal ("needed it done sooner", "couldn't wait"); cross-reference each class with specific operational metrics: quote latency, quote pricing vs market, engineer who produced the quote
**INSIGHT:** Separates three entirely different operational problems that all look the same in a conversion rate number; acting on the wrong signal wastes resources; acting on the right one directly moves conversion rate
**ACTION:** Monthly rejection classification report; if price signal dominates: review quote templates against current market rates; if trust signal dominates: add testimonials and certifications to quote documents; if speed signal dominates: set 4-hour quote turnaround target and assign production to dedicated admin role
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £19,600/yr additional revenue (5pp improvement in win rate on planned work: 14 additional jobs × £1,400 average)

**PUBLIC DATA:** CIPD UK Labour Market Outlook (skilled trades turnover benchmarks); ONS Construction Labour Turnover data
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply VADER lexicon-based sentiment to rolling 90-day internal message corpus per engineer; compute weekly frustration language density score; secondary features: message response latency, swear word/complaint phrase density, emoji sentiment shift, job-note length trend; combine into 4-week rolling attrition-risk score; cross-reference against overtime hours (30 days) and certification renewal engagement
**INSIGHT:** Engineer attrition in trades SMBs is catastrophic and sudden — owner typically has 2–4 weeks' warning; the signal in communication data fires 8–16 weeks earlier, consistently; cost of losing a qualified Gas Safe plumber runs £15,000–£35,000 per departure
**ACTION:** When attrition risk score crosses threshold: initiate private one-to-one conversation (framed around wellbeing, not monitoring); intervene on root cause: overwork → reduce overtime; equipment frustration → fix van/tools; pay → bring review forward

**TITLE:** Customer Email Semantic Complexity Trend as Churn Prediction Signal (Trades)
**VERTICAL:** Trades
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Customer email correspondence (Gmail/Outlook matched to FSM customer records); WhatsApp message history with customers; inbound call transcript archives
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each maintenance contract customer, build rolling 6-month communication profile: (a) message length trend; (b) semantic richness score (type-token ratio — unique words/total words); (c) response latency trend; (d) topic breadth. Apply embedding-distance drift detection: compute mean embedding vector (customer messages, 90-day window) vs prior 90-day window; cosine distance >0.25 indicates meaningful semantic shift
**INSIGHT:** Customers do not suddenly cancel maintenance contracts; they psychologically disengage 8–16 weeks before cancellation; disengagement is visible in communication texture weeks before the cancellation email arrives — matches SaaS churn prediction research (Zuora: communication frequency drops 6–10 weeks before formal churn)
**ACTION:** Monthly churn-risk report for maintenance contract customers; high-risk customers receive proactive outreach: phone call from owner or senior engineer framed as a relationship check-in, not a retention pitch; surfaces the real concern before the contract lapses
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £70,000 NPV (reducing contract churn from 18% to 11%: £14,000/yr protected recurring revenue on £200,000 contract book over 5-year LTV at 85% retention)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Customer LTV modelling (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990); embedding-based semantic drift (cosine similarity on sentence-transformers — all-MiniLM-L6-v2); Zipf's Law applied to communication decay; Zuora subscription economy churn literature

**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office DataHub API (7-day hourly forecast: temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours, wind speed); Newcastle City Council event calendar; National school holiday calendar; Premier League/EFL fixture list
**FUSION LOGIC:** Gradient-boosted regression (XGBoost or LightGBM) trained on 24+ months of historical covers data with weather, calendar, and event features; features include max temperature, hours of sunshine, cumulative rain from midday, school holiday flag, nearest major event within 0.5km, day-of-week, NUFC home fixture flag; output hourly cover forecast for next 7 days
**INSIGHT:** Weather accounts for 15–25% of daily cover variance in wet-led and outdoor-capable venues; a gradient-boosted model trained on local Met Office data achieves ±10% cover accuracy at 7-day horizon
**ACTION:** Automated rota recommendation 6 days in advance; prep quantity guidance to kitchen; dynamic reservations availability release (hold tables for walk-ins if forecast predicts high footfall, release via OpenTable if poor forecast)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £9,000–£20,000/yr (2–5% labour cost reduction + 1–3% food wastage reduction on a venue with £150k annual labour and £100k food cost)

**PUBLIC DATA:** FSA FHRS API (free, no registration required, daily updated — all UK food business hygiene ratings with geolocation); Google My Business reviews (via Google Business Profile API)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Pull all FHRS-rated competitors within defined radius (0.5–2km); calculate relative hygiene rating (own score vs cluster mean and minimum); apply NLP sentiment analysis to own review corpus extracting themes tagged to cleanliness, food safety, and hygiene; correlate sentiment drift on hygiene themes against repeat-booking trajectory
**INSIGHT:** Venues with FHRS scores below their local cluster mean show statistically higher likelihood of negative review sentiment spikes within 30–60 days of next inspection; proactive hygiene investment before the inspection window closes the gap
**ACTION:** Monthly hygiene position report — own score, cluster mean, nearest competitor scores; alert when own score drifts below cluster mean; prioritise hygiene capital spend on areas linked to recent review sentiment themes
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£50,000/yr protected (preventing a hygiene score downgrade from 5 to 3 avoids 12–18% revenue loss over the following quarter)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)

**INTERNAL DATA:** Reservation history (booking date, source, party size, time of booking, lead time); historical no-show log; POS data (no-show days vs revenue impact)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office 7-day weather forecast; school holiday calendar; local event calendar; Barclays Spend Analytics (aggregated spend data — available to businesses via Barclays partnership)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Train a no-show probability model: features include booking source, party size, lead time (days between booking and slot), weather forecast for the booked date, day-of-week, whether booked during a local event period, first-time vs repeat booker; output probability per reservation; calibrate deposit trigger threshold at optimal revenue-maximising point
**INSIGHT:** UK no-show rates rose to 14% of all bookings in 2024; a 40-cover restaurant with 14% no-show rate loses approximately 5–6 covers per service; converting high-probability no-shows to deposit-secured bookings recovers 40–60% of lost revenue
**ACTION:** Two-tier deposit policy: low-risk bookings — confirmation SMS/email; high-risk (predicted probability >20%) — card-on-file pre-authorisation via OpenTable/ResDiary natively; cancel trigger for pre-authorised no-shows
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £18,000–£25,000/yr (40-cover restaurant: 5–6 covers/service × 2 services/day × 14% no-show × 40% deposit recovery × £35 SPH)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Expected value modelling; Bayesian classification; revenue management (hotel overbooking theory applied to restaurant covers)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Revenue management in hotels solved the no-show problem via deposits and dynamic pricing in the 1970s. The restaurant industry is 40 years behind the same discovery.

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS food inflation indices (CPIH component breakdown for food categories); seasonal ingredient price indices; ONS Household Spending data (dining occasion frequency by category)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Classify each menu item into the BCG-adapted quadrant: Stars (high popularity + high margin), Plowhorses (high popularity + low margin), Puzzles (low popularity + high margin), Dogs (low popularity + low margin); compute contribution margin per item; overlay seasonal ingredient cost index to flag items whose cost structure is expected to deteriorate; track quadrant migration month-on-month
**INSIGHT:** A typical 60-item menu has 8–12 Stars driving 60–70% of profit; removing or reorienting 6–8 Dogs reduces kitchen complexity without revenue loss; menu engineering studies consistently show 3–8% revenue uplift and 2–4% margin improvement in the 90 days post-restructure
**ACTION:** Quarterly menu review against Stars/Plowhorses/Puzzles/Dogs matrix; remove persistent Dogs; reposition Puzzles through placement, naming, and suggestive selling; protect Stars against cost increases by tracking PLU-level margin monthly
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£40,000/yr (3–8% revenue uplift + 2–4% margin improvement on a £500k food revenue venue)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Ofgem energy price data; National Grid ESO day-ahead demand forecasts; ONS energy consumption benchmarks for hospitality sector
**FUSION LOGIC:** Cross-reference half-hourly energy consumption against POS transaction volume; compute energy-per-cover ratio by hour; identify anomalous consumption spikes not correlated with covers (equipment faults, idle equipment left on, off-peak lighting waste); track energy-per-cover trend against Ofgem published tariff to build true cost-per-cover metric
**INSIGHT:** Hospitality energy costs remain 75% above pre-2021 levels; smart meter analysis typically reveals 10–15% waste from idle equipment and off-peak consumption; energy-per-cover rising faster than cover count is a structural margin headwind
**ACTION:** Automated idle-equipment alert when consumption spikes outside operational hours; load-shifting (pre-chill walk-in cooler during off-peak tariff periods); equipment maintenance schedule triggered by consumption anomaly (a fridge drawing 30% more current than baseline probably has a failing compressor seal)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,600–£5,400/yr (10–15% energy reduction on a venue spending £3,000/month)

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS BICS consumer confidence data (leading indicator of discretionary hiring market — staff leave for better opportunities when confidence is high); Indeed/Reed UK hospitality job posting volumes by region (proxy for competitor hiring intensity)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build per-employee early warning score: shift acceptance rate trend (declining = disengagement), swap frequency increasing (scheduling dissatisfaction), last-minute cancellations trend, days since last positive manager feedback note; overlay with local job market tightness (Indeed posting volume by region) to assess flight risk; flag when composite score exceeds threshold
**INSIGHT:** 42% of hospitality staff leave in the first 90 days; cost of replacing a front-of-house worker is £1,400–£2,400 (advertising, induction, training, lost productivity); detecting flight risk 4–6 weeks ahead allows retention intervention
**ACTION:** When individual early warning score exceeds threshold: one-to-one with manager focusing on role satisfaction; hours review (often the precipitating factor); recognition intervention; for Managers specifically, flag to senior leadership
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £8,400–£14,400/yr (avoiding 6 departures per year × average £1,400–£2,400 replacement cost on a 15-person team with 75% annual churn reduced to 55%)

**PUBLIC DATA:** NHS England seasonal illness surveillance data (respiratory illness, norovirus, flu activity by region and week — published free on UKHSA dashboard); UKHSA weekly national flu and COVID-19 surveillance report
**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress historical unplanned absence rate against NHS illness surveillance indicators for the same region lagged 5–10 days (illness peaks community → then affects workforce); compute "peak-day absence risk score" for the next 3 weeks; model required standby cover based on historical absence rates during illness peaks
**INSIGHT:** Unplanned absences on peak trading days (Friday/Saturday/Sunday) generate approximately 8–15% revenue shortfall and disproportionate customer dissatisfaction; NHS flu surveillance data provides 7–10 day lead time on regional illness peaks
**ACTION:** Maintain a vetted pool of 2–3 standby staff per role with confirmed availability during illness peaks; brief standby pool when risk score rises above threshold; order reduced prep on high-risk days to limit exposure if understaffing materialises
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,000–£8,000/yr (converting one peak-day scramble-staffing situation per month into managed standby arrangement avoids 8–15% revenue shortfall × 12 events × average £800 affected service revenue)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**PUBLIC DATA:** HMRC cash economy reports; BII (British Institute of Innkeeping) benchmarks on acceptable shrinkage rates; ONS crime data (industry theft patterns)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply Benford's Law to transaction amounts by server (anomalous leading-digit distribution indicates manipulation); SPC control charts on void rates by server and time period (>2σ above team mean = statistical anomaly); cross-reference stock variance above 3% GP gap with specific shift/server combinations using POS data
**INSIGHT:** Industry estimates suggest 1–3% of hospitality revenue is lost to internal theft annually; for a venue turning over £500k, this is £5,000–£15,000; Benford's Law catches manipulation patterns invisible to manual review
**ACTION:** Weekly void report flagged for management review; Benford's Law analysis monthly; where statistical anomaly confirmed, initiate formal investigation process with HR involvement; adjust cash-handling controls
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £4,000–£12,000/yr (closing 50% of identified shrinkage gap on a mid-size venue)

**PUBLIC DATA:** FSA FHRS API (allergen-related inspection failure data patterns at peer venues); FSA Food Allergy alert system (product withdrawal notices relevant to stocked ingredients); FSA allergen data
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a risk score per dish combining: (a) number of allergens present; (b) similarity to common "allergen confusion" pairings (nuts in salads, gluten in sauces, shellfish in stocks); (c) modification risk (how easily can the dish be mismodified?); (d) staff training currency on allergen awareness; overlay with FSA peer inspection data to identify if own practice matches failure patterns at similar venues
**INSIGHT:** The majority of allergen incidents occur not because allergens are present but because communication, training, or system gaps allow information to be lost between kitchen and customer; Natasha's Law (October 2021) creates strict liability with unlimited fines and potential imprisonment
**ACTION:** Monthly allergen matrix audit; mandatory staff allergen training calendar with automated reminder when certificates expire; FSA-triggered ingredient review when relevant product withdrawal notices are issued

**FUSION LOGIC:** Build rolling licence compliance calendar: annual fee due date alert (60/30/14 days), DPS personal licence renewal alert, any conditions-compliance review dates; cross-reference with IDOX public register to verify that own licence details are correctly recorded and no pending review applications from third parties
**INSIGHT:** A suspended premises licence through missed annual fee is catastrophic — the venue cannot legally serve alcohol until reinstated; a DPS whose personal licence has lapsed exposes the premises to an immediate suspension application
**ACTION:** Automated 90/60/30-day alerts for all licence compliance milestones; annual licence conditions audit (ensuring actual operations match documented conditions); monitor IDOX for competitor licence reviews — potential market share opportunity when a competitor faces review

**FUSION LOGIC:** Compare own rateable value against comparable premises in the VOA database; compute whether a valuation challenge is warranted (comparable evidence methodology); model the financial impact of a successful appeal: annual rates saving × years remaining in current valuation period; calculate whether the appeal cost (surveyor fees) is justified against expected saving
**INSIGHT:** Many hospitality SMBs are paying materially above-market rates because they have not challenged their valuation; the 2023 revaluation reset values to April 2021 rental levels, which may not reflect post-COVID trading conditions for some venues
**ACTION:** Annual rates review against VOA comparables; where comparable evidence suggests an overvaluation, appoint a rating surveyor on a success-fee basis; apply for all applicable reliefs (retail/hospitality/leisure relief has been extended)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Delivery platform published commission rate schedules (Deliveroo 20–35%, Uber Eats 30%, Just Eat 14%+ for Scoober model); ONS data on food delivery market growth trends; Barclays/Visa aggregate delivery spend data
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each dish: calculate true net margin after all aggregator fees (commission, packaging, VAT treatment) and kitchen costs; compare to dine-in margin for equivalent dish; identify "fee inversion" dishes where delivery net margin has fallen below dine-in margin; calculate the contribution of aggregator revenue to total covers and whether declining it would free kitchen capacity for higher-margin dine-in
**INSIGHT:** At 30% Deliveroo commission, a dish with 65% food GP retains only 35% of revenue before packaging and kitchen cost; for dishes with food GP below 65%, delivery margin may be negative; aggregator-dependent venues lose 15–20% of revenue in fees before the kitchen has started cooking
**ACTION:** Fee audit per dish per platform; migrate high-margin items to direct ordering channels (own website via hungrrr or flipdish); remove loss-making delivery-only items; negotiate rates at >£10k/month delivery revenue level
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £9,360–£18,000/yr (£3,000/week delivery revenue venue moving 20% to direct channel: saves 20–30% commission on £600/week = £1,800/month × 12 = £21,600, less direct channel cost)

**INSIGHT:** Google Business Profile is the primary discovery channel for most hospitality SMBs but almost no operators measure the funnel from search to seat; direction requests are a strong proxy for imminent visits (88% of direction requests result in a visit within 24 hours per Google's own data)
**ACTION:** Weekly GBP dashboard; minimum 4 new photos per month (algorithmic ranking factor); respond to all reviews within 24 hours; use GBP Posts for weekly specials and events; A/B test menu descriptions against search-impression-to-click rate

**FUSION LOGIC:** Build time-series of: own average response time to reviews (in hours), own average star rating, own cover count; test Granger causality: does reduced response time Granger-cause improved rating in subsequent weeks? Compute the "response time elasticity to rating" — how much does a 1-hour reduction in average response time move rating by?
**INSIGHT:** Approximately 16% of a local business's Google ranking depends on reviews; businesses that respond faster to negative reviews show 0.3–0.5 star recovery on rolling average within 90 days; 53% of customers expect a response to a negative review within a week
**ACTION:** Implement a 24-hour review response protocol (all reviews, positive and negative); use a personalised response template that acknowledges specific feedback rather than generic thanks; assign review response ownership to a named team member
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £12,000–£24,000/yr (moving 0.3 stars above local cluster average: estimated 5–10% cover uplift from improved search ranking × average cover value)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Newcastle City Council events calendar (data.gov.uk); Utilita Arena Newcastle events (public calendar); NUFC fixture list (public); Great North Run and other race calendars; Barclays consumer spending data showing 4.1% stadium-proximity uplift on match days
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build event-day revenue model: for each event type (NUFC match, Utilita Arena concert, Great North Run, Newcastle Film Festival), compute the historical uplift vs day-matched baseline from POS data; classify events by revenue impact tier; use reservations pacing data to build early-warning system for when an event day is not booking ahead of normal pace (indicating event impact may not materialise — adjust cover holds accordingly)
**INSIGHT:** Barclays data shows spending within 1km of football stadiums rises 4.1% on match days nationally; for a pub within 500m of St James' Park, match day uplift may be 15–40%; event-day pacing typically runs 3–4 days ahead of normal for same-day bookings
**ACTION:** Pre-build event-specific rotas 2 weeks in advance for all Tier 1 events; adjust drinks par stock by 25–40% on event days; set cover holds for walk-ins during peak match-day periods; build an event-specific drinks promotion pre-confirmed for all NUFC home days
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000/yr (pub capturing 50% more wet revenue on 20 NUFC home match days per year at £2,000 average match-day wet revenue = £1,000 uplift × 20 matches)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Difference-in-differences causal modelling; event econometrics
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The same event calendar that tells the Newcastle Marriott to price hotel rooms at 3× their normal rate on Bigg Market weekends tells you to stock an extra keg of the away team's local ale. The data is public; the uplift is real; almost no independent operators systematically plan for it

**TITLE:** Student Term-Time / Holiday Flex Modelling (Hospitality)
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** POS weekly revenue; covers by daypart; spend-per-head; booking lead times; staff nationality/university enrollment records (if relevant to understanding seasonal availability)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Newcastle University and Northumbria University academic calendar (publicly published); ONS population estimates for Newcastle wards; student accommodation density map (Newcastle Planning Portal)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a seasonality decomposition model keyed to academic calendar milestones: Freshers' Week, term start dates, Reading Weeks, exam periods, inter-semester gaps, summer; identify which daypart and day-of-week revenue is most correlated with term-time population presence; model staffing and stock requirements for each phase
**INSIGHT:** Student populations (Newcastle: ~50,000 students across both universities) create strong cyclical demand patterns in food and drink venues near campus and nightlife zones; summer (student absence) creates a structural trough that catches operators who have not planned for it
**ACTION:** Seasonal staffing model keyed to academic calendar; reduce fixed hours by 15–20% during summer trough; negotiate flexible hours arrangements with student staff to retain during term-time peaks; shift marketing focus during summer to local residential population and tourism
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £5,200/yr (eliminating 2 weeks of summer over-staffing at 20% excess labour cost for a £2,500/week payroll)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Cyclical demand modelling; customer segment lifecycle; seasonal decomposition (STL method)
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.~.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The academic calendar is the most predictable demand cycle in the hospitality sector — every date is published 18 months in advance. A venue near Newcastle University that has not built its annual plan around this calendar is ignoring the most reliable forward signal available

**TITLE:** Metro/Rail Disruption Impact on Footfall
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Daily cover count; walk-in conversion rate; hourly POS transaction volume
**PUBLIC DATA:** Nexus Metro Real-Time Information API (service status, disruption alerts for Tyne and Wear Metro — free); National Rail Darwin Live Departure Boards API (disruption data for Newcastle Central, Metrocentre, and regional stations); StreetManager API (roadworks affecting key pedestrian routes)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor Nexus Metro service status in near-real-time; when Metro disruption is confirmed on routes serving the venue's catchment area (e.g., Yellow Line disruption affecting Jesmond, Heaton, and city centre connections), automatically: (a) model expected footfall reduction using historical disruption impact data; (b) trigger messaging to pre-booked customers; (c) consider delivery capacity increase if platform kitchen available
**INSIGHT:** The Tyne and Wear Metro serves 44 stations; key hospitality districts (Quayside, Jesmond, Heaton, Gateshead) are Metro-dependent for significant customer flow; major disruption events (line closures, strikes) demonstrably reduce walk-in covers by 20–40% for venues more than 600m from a bus alternative
**ACTION:** Real-time Metro disruption alert integrated into operations; proactive SMS to pre-booked customers on disruption days with public transport alternatives or rebooking offer; operational decision framework (run reduced rota if disruption confirmed by 8am)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,600/yr (converting 30% footfall loss into 15% loss through proactive messaging and delivery channel: £1,200 protected per quarter per 4 disruption events)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Real-time operational intelligence; demand diversion modelling
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The Nexus Metro Real-Time API is the same data that Uber uses to surge pricing during service disruptions. A pub near Jesmond Metro can use the same API to decide whether to put on an extra member of bar staff or to proactively offer Deliveroo capacity when the line goes down

**TITLE:** Air Quality and Al-Fresco Booking Demand
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Beer garden / al-fresco cover count; total venue covers; time-stamped bookings requesting outdoor seating; weather vs actual outdoor demand
**PUBLIC DATA:** DEFRA UK Air Quality Index (DAQI) — hourly API for local air quality by monitoring station; Met Office UV index and pollen forecast (relevant to outdoor preference and allergy concerns)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a composite "outdoor demand score": Met Office temperature + sunshine hours + DEFRA DAQI (clean air = higher outdoor preference) + UV index (extreme UV = lower outdoor preference); correlate historical composite score against outdoor cover fill rate; build predictive model for outdoor cover demand with 24-hour advance; adjust reservations availability (release additional outdoor covers or redirect to indoor) based on predicted score
**INSIGHT:** Al-fresco dining demand is not driven by temperature alone; air quality, wind speed, and UV index together explain 35–45% of variance in outdoor cover preference; on days with DAQI 7 (High) or above, outdoor cover fill rate drops 25–40% even with warm temperatures
**ACTION:** Dynamic al-fresco availability management: open outdoor covers when composite score is favourable; redirect to indoor when score is poor; adjust outdoor décor/cover offers for pollen season (allergy-friendly menu note)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £2,000–£6,000/yr (venue losing 20 outdoor covers per service on 10 high-pollution days per year: 20 covers × £35 SPH × 10 days = £7,000 at risk; recovering 30% through advance redirection = £2,100)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Environmental demand modelling; customer preference analysis; time-series regression
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.1.i

**TITLE:** Cost-of-Living Pulse — ONS BICS Consumer Confidence Overlay
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Weekly revenue trend; average spend per head (SPH); covers by category (food, drink); promotion redemption rate; reservation cancellation rate
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) — fortnightly, covers business turnover impact, workforce, and financial performance indicators by sector; ONS Consumer Price Index; BoE/GfK Consumer Confidence Index
**FUSION LOGIC:** Lag ONS BICS consumer confidence measure against own SPH trend with 4–8 week lag; build a "demand compression model" that signals when cost-of-living pressure is shifting customer behaviour from à la carte to set menu, from starters to mains-only, from wine to house pours; use early signals in the BICS data to anticipate the move before it appears in own P&L
**INSIGHT:** The cost-of-living crisis is not uniform — it affects specific price points and occasions first; mid-week dining is cut before weekend; starter removal comes before main course downgrade; detecting SPH compression 6 weeks early enables a targeted prix fixe promotion to retain volume at acceptable margin
**ACTION:** When BICS/GfK consumer confidence falls 5+ points from trailing 12-week average, activate "value positioning" promotional response: prix fixe menu, early-bird offer, or "Sunday Roast deal" to maintain cover volume at reduced margin rather than losing covers entirely
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £12,000–£20,000/yr (venue detecting SPH compression 6 weeks early and deploying prix fixe retaining 90% of covers at 85% SPH vs 70% of covers at full SPH: 20% more covers × average £35 = material protection)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Leading indicator econometrics; elasticity of demand by occasion type; scenario planning
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The ONS BICS survey is essentially the same leading indicator framework that Goldman Sachs uses to adjust its GDP forecasts quarterly — but published free, with a 2-week lag, and directly applicable to a 40-cover restaurant deciding whether to launch a prix fixe menu next month

**TITLE:** Deposit / No-Show Policy ROI Calculator
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical no-show rate by day and slot; average revenue per cover (SPH); variable cost per cover (food cost + direct labour)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Zonal/CGA no-show benchmark data (14% industry average, 2024); ResDiary published research on deposit policy effectiveness; UK consumer law (Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 — deposit retention rules)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Model expected revenue impact of introducing deposits: (recovered revenue per no-show under deposit × probability of retention after deposit policy × volume of affected bookings) minus (cost of deposit processing, bookings lost due to deposit resistance); compute NPV under different deposit thresholds (£5, £10, £20 per head) and trigger thresholds (all bookings, >4 covers, >6 covers, Friday/Saturday only)
**INSIGHT:** 95% of Michelin 3-star restaurants charge cancellation fees; growing numbers of mid-market operators are implementing deposits; for a 40-cover restaurant recovering 50% of 14% no-show revenue at £35 SPH: £35 × 40 × 14% × 50% = £98 per service; over 600 annual services = £58,800 potential recovery
**ACTION:** Introduce card-on-file pre-authorisation (not charge) for all bookings >4 covers and for all Saturday evening bookings regardless of size; activate automatically in ResDiary or OpenTable (both support this natively)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £18,000–£58,800/yr depending on policy scope and venue size
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Expected value maximisation; price psychology (deposits signal commitment from both sides); consumer contracts law
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The deposit model solved the ghost-booking problem in theatre ticketing, airline seating, and hotel reservations before restaurants adopted it. The economics are identical: a committed customer who has skin in the game shows up. A customer who has clicked "book" for free treats the booking as optional

**TITLE:** Corkage and Tip Pool Compliance Audit
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** POS tip capture data (card-added gratuities, service charges collected as line item); payroll tip distribution records; any contractual terms relating to service charge allocation
**PUBLIC DATA:** Employment (Allocation of Tips) Act 2023 statutory code of practice (GOV.UK); HMRC guidance on tip taxation; ACAS guidance on the Tipping Act; Employment Tribunal decisions database (HMCTS)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Reconcile POS tip capture against payroll tip distribution: (a) total tips captured per week; (b) total tips distributed per week per employee; (c) gap analysis; (d) verification that the gap does not represent retained tip income (illegal under the Tipping Act 2023); also audit service charge line items — where service charge is not optional in the wording, it must be distributed to staff or face liability
**INSIGHT:** The Tipping Act 2023 creates a statutory right for staff to bring Employment Tribunal claims of up to £5,000 per worker for tip non-compliance; for a venue with 15 tipping-eligible staff, potential total liability is £75,000; HMRC also classifies tip fraud as tax evasion
**ACTION:** Immediate payroll audit; introduce a written tipping policy per the statutory code; implement a tip distribution system (Tipjar, TipSplit, or equivalent) that creates an auditable trail; display the tipping policy visibly as required by the Act
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £75,000+ in avoided liability (per worker maximum claim × typical tipped workforce size) + HMRC penalty avoidance
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Statutory compliance audit; employment law risk management; forensic payroll reconciliation
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.=.1.p

**TITLE:** Dynamic Room Pricing — Boutique Hotel / B&B
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** PMS booking data (booking date, arrival date, rate paid, channel, length of stay, room type); historical occupancy by date; booking pace curves (how many rooms are booked X days before arrival for any given date type)
**PUBLIC DATA:** OTA competitor pricing (Booking.com, Expedia — publicly displayed, extractable for own competitive set using PicoClaw on a scheduled basis); local event calendar; VisitEngland/VisitBritain regional occupancy data (published quarterly)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a rate-setting decision model: (a) book-pace vs historical average for the same date type — running ahead of pace triggers rate increase; (b) competitor rate cluster (OTA pricing of 3–5 comparable properties); (c) event-day premium trigger (local events drive systematic premium); (d) last-minute discount trigger (within 72 hours with >30% rooms unsold); produce a daily rate recommendation per room type
**INSIGHT:** Independent hotels using dynamic pricing see revenue increases of 10–25% versus static pricing; a 10-room B&B at £80 ADR and 65% occupancy achieves £189,800 annual room revenue; a 15% ADR improvement via dynamic pricing adds £28,470/yr — more than the cost of a full-time employee
**ACTION:** Weekly rate review using the decision model; automate competitor rate monitoring via PicoClaw scheduled extraction; apply event calendar premium automatically for confirmed high-demand dates; implement last-minute discount protocol for Sundays and Mondays only (demand-elastic days)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £19,000–£47,000/yr (10–25% ADR improvement on a 10-room property at £80 baseline ADR and 65% occupancy)

**ID:** INS-055
**TITLE:** GP% Below Format Floor — Hospitality Death Spiral
**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** DeathSpiral
**INTERNAL DATA:** Stock-take records (theoretical vs actual GP% by category, by period); POS category-level revenue; COGS records
**PUBLIC DATA:** Hospitality sector GP benchmarks (wet GP% floor: 60%; food GP% floor: 55%); ACG industry analysis (hospitality sector revenue 2023–2026)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor wet GP% and food GP% on each stock-take cycle; flag any category below format floor for two consecutive stock-take periods; distinguish one-off cost spike from structural change using SPC control chart
**INSIGHT:** GP% below format floor for two consecutive periods is not a cost spike — it is a structural change in purchasing behaviour, menu pricing, or loss rates; the sector death-zone begins here; average hospitality sector labour is 31.2% of sales; above 35% is a structural warning; above 40% is a death-spiral indicator
**ACTION:** Immediate root cause analysis (theft/waste/pricing failure); category-level P&L review; emergency menu repricing if materials cost-driven
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £50,000–£200,000/yr protected (preventing the compounding effect of below-floor GP% across all operating overhead)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Contribution margin analysis; Altman Z'' financial fragility; Forrester reinforcing loops
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The format floor is the financial equivalent of a dam: the moment it is breached, the waters above (revenue) have nowhere to go except through the hole (losses). The stock-take is the only measurement device that detects the breach before the dam fails

**TYPE:** DeathSpiral
**INTERNAL DATA:** HR records (hire date, departure date, role, department); exit interview data (reason for departure)
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS labour market data for hospitality sector; CIPD UK Labour Market Outlook (hospitality sector voluntary turnover benchmarks)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Compute median tenure for front-of-house staff on a rolling 12-month basis; flag when median drops below 90 days; track by role and by manager to distinguish systemic vs localised failure
**INSIGHT:** Front-of-house median tenure below 90 days means the venue is in permanent replacement mode; the 42% first-90-day departure rate is the hospitality sector's most costly structural problem; below 90 days, quality and customer experience are structurally degraded
**ACTION:** Immediate culture and management review; exit interview analysis (typically surfaces 2–3 actionable root causes within first 10 interviews); compensation benchmarking against local competitors
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £8,400–£14,400/yr in avoided replacement costs alone; immeasurable customer experience and revenue protection value
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier); human capital ROI; Schein Organisational Culture Levels
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.2.i

**TYPE:** DeathSpiral
**INTERNAL DATA:** POS channel revenue split (dine-in, delivery, takeaway, room service); aggregator transaction data (commission rates, net revenue by platform)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Delivery platform commission schedules; UKHospitality commentary on aggregator dependency risk
**FUSION LOGIC:** Compute weekly delivery aggregator revenue as % of total food revenue; flag when sustained above 25%; compute net delivery contribution margin vs dine-in contribution margin — flag if delivery net margin is below dine-in net margin (revenue mix appears positive but is margin-negative)
**INSIGHT:** While delivery growth sounds positive, if aggregator-driven revenue exceeds 25% of food sales, the venue is increasingly dependent on 20–35% commission-charged revenue; net delivery margin below dine-in margin creates a revenue mix that looks healthy but is margin-negative; also: customer data belongs to the aggregator, not the venue
**ACTION:** Initiate direct-ordering channel development (own website ordering, in-venue QR code); cap aggregator-dependency growth; begin systematic customer data collection from delivery customers via loyalty programme
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£30,000/yr margin protection (moving 20% of delivery volume to direct channel at 20–30% cost saving vs aggregator commission)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Channel economics; contribution margin analysis; competitive moat erosion
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.3.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** A venue that allows its aggregator dependency to grow past 30% has handed its customer relationship to a third party.

**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** DeathSpiral
**INTERNAL DATA:** Own review corpus (Google, Tripadvisor, OpenTable) with timestamps; covers and revenue for the same period
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required (pure internal signal)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply NLP analysis to review text on a rolling 8-week window; monitor emergence and growth of service-failure themes: "wait", "slow", "cold", "forgotten", "understaffed"; flag when any theme grows >15pp in proportion over 4 consecutive weeks; cross-reference with rota data to identify if understaffing is the root cause
**INSIGHT:** NLP analysis of review text showing increasing mentions of service failure themes over 8-week rolling window predicts a rating drop within 6–10 weeks and a cover decline within 3–4 months; reviews are a lagging indicator of the operational problem; the text drift is the leading indicator
**ACTION:** Immediate operational investigation when service-theme drift is detected; staffing review; kitchen throughput audit; service sequence review
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£50,000/yr protected (preventing a 0.3-star rating drop and associated 5–10% cover decline on a £1m revenue venue)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** BERTopic topic modelling; leading indicator NLP (Pontiki et al., SemEval); Taleb "silent accumulation" (Antifragile)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The six-week drift in review language is the hospitality equivalent of a cockpit instrument warning light — it fires before the engine fails, not after. The engine failure is the rating drop; the warning light is the topic drift in customer language

**VERTICAL:** Hospitality
**TYPE:** DeathSpiral
**INTERNAL DATA:** VAT return filing dates and payment dates; PAYE payment records; Time to Pay arrangement status; payroll summary
**PUBLIC DATA:** HMRC enforcement data; CLH News analysis of hospitality insolvency causes; Insolvency Service Gazette (winding-up petitions)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor VAT payment timeliness against quarterly due dates; monitor PAYE payment timeliness against monthly due dates; flag any payment more than 14 days late; model the compound liability if current trajectory continues (late VAT + surcharge + PAYE arrears)
**INSIGHT:** Late VAT filing or payment is a near-immediate insolvency signal; HMRC is the largest creditor in most hospitality insolvencies; the presence of a Time to Pay arrangement is not itself a red flag, but repeated deferrals are; HMRC regained secondary preferential creditor status in December 2020 for VAT and PAYE
**ACTION:** Immediate HMRC voluntary disclosure; Time to Pay Arrangement application before enforcement; emergency cashflow assessment; legal advice on options (CVA vs administration vs CVL)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** Business survival signal — the compound cost of HMRC enforcement vs voluntary disclosure is asymmetric; early disclosure typically saves £10,000–£50,000 in penalties and professional fees
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** UK insolvency law (CIGA 2020); Altman Z'' (working capital component); Collins Stage 4/5 decline
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** HMRC's preferential creditor status (reinstated 2020) means that in a liquidation, HMRC is paid before the bank's floating charge — a structural change that makes HMRC arrears more dangerous than pre-2020.

**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office DataPoint API (hourly weather by location); local authority events calendars; National Rail/TfL disruption APIs; school term dates (GOV.UK); StreetManager API (roadworks)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress historical footfall against weather (temperature, rainfall, wind), school holidays, local market days, and recorded transport disruptions; build rolling 14-day footfall forecast; assign probability bands to staffing levels
**INSIGHT:** Weather, school terms, local events, and transport disruption together explain 25–40% of retail footfall variance; a 14-day forecast enables staffing decisions that eliminate unproductive labour hours without service quality impact
**ACTION:** Dynamic rota scheduling — reduce staffing 20% on predicted low-footfall days, increase on event days; pre-brief store team on expected volumes each Monday for the following 7 days
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000/yr (5% reduction in unproductive labour hours on a £400k payroll)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Port of Felixstowe/Southampton container dwell data (UK Port statistics, DfT); HMRC UK Trade Info (import volumes by commodity code); Bank of England spot FX rates; ONS trade bulletin on container ship rerouting
**FUSION LOGIC:** When shipping times from key origin countries exceed historical mean + 1.5 SD, flag SKUs within 30 days of stockout; cross-reference with HMRC import volume slowdowns in relevant HS codes; FX deterioration on USD/GBP dynamically elevates reorder cost; model whether airfreight premium (6–10× sea) is justified vs lost-sale cost
**INSIGHT:** 85% of UK freight by weight moves by sea; supply chain disruption (container rerouting, port dwell spikes) adds weeks to transit times and is predictable from publicly available port data 2–4 weeks ahead; stockout costs typically exceed the airfreight premium for high-margin items
**ACTION:** Trigger early reorder at 70% of normal reorder point during disruption flags; model airfreight justification for priority SKUs; build 6-week buffer stock for top-10 revenue SKUs from high-risk origins
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£40,000/yr (preventing 2–3 major stockout events per year at £5,000–£15,000 average lost revenue and margin per event)

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS CPI sub-indices by category (clothing & footwear, household goods, food); ONS RPI; ONS Retail Price Index item-level data
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each SKU category, estimate own-price elasticity using historical price/volume data; benchmark own price trajectory against ONS sector CPI; identify categories where own prices have risen faster than sector CPI (risk of demand drop) or slower (margin recovery opportunity); run natural experiment framework using price-change periods vs control periods
**INSIGHT:** Categories where own prices have risen faster than ONS sector CPI risk demand loss; categories where own prices are below sector CPI have untapped margin recovery opportunity; a 2% price improvement on a £500k turnover = £10k incremental gross margin
**ACTION:** Category-level pricing authority matrix: auto-trigger price test when own-price diverges >5% from sector CPI trend; semi-annual SKU-level price review against ONS benchmarks
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£20,000/yr (2–4% price improvement on appropriate category segments)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Track commercial void rate within 500m of each store location using quarterly Land Registry data; a rising void rate signals catchment demand deterioration — a leading indicator of own footfall decline by 6–12 months; also monitor newly vacated adjacent units as rent negotiation leverage
**INSIGHT:** Rising local commercial void rate is a 6–12 month leading indicator of retail footfall decline; the reverse is also true — an incoming anchor tenant (food hall, gym) is a footfall generator 6–12 months ahead; both signals are free from Land Registry data
**ACTION:** Trigger rent renegotiation when local commercial void rate rises >3pp in 12 months; monitor for incoming complementary anchor tenants; use void rate trend as evidence in lease renewal negotiations
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £5,000–£20,000/yr in protected rent terms (landlord negotiation leverage based on demonstrable demand deterioration) + lease extension protection

**TITLE:** Competitor Death-Spiral Detection via Companies House + Gazette (Retail)
**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Competitor
**INTERNAL DATA:** Known competitor list (Companies House numbers); category overlap; postcode proximity
**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House insolvency streaming API; The Gazette daily insolvency notice feed; Companies House filing deadlines; Creditsafe/Experian alerts (paid augmentation of free data)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor Companies House for: accounts filed late (>9 months from year-end), negative net assets on most recent balance sheet, director changes, dissolution application; cross-reference Gazette for winding-up petitions or administration appointments; weight signals into composite "competitor distress score"
**INSIGHT:** When a competitor hits Red distress score: (a) targeted local advertising spend uplift, (b) outreach to their suppliers, (c) consideration of their lease/fixtures if administration proceeds; staff acquisition opportunity also arises
**ACTION:** Monthly automated distress score update for top 10 competitors; trigger campaign when Red threshold crossed; alert to landlord / commercial agent if competitor premises would be valuable
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£80,000 (capturing 15–20% of a distressed competitor's customer base during a 3–6 month distress window)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z'' (applied to competitors); competitive intelligence; Porter Five Forces (rivalry dynamics)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The Gazette's daily insolvency notice feed is the official UK record of business failure. It is read by bailiffs, liquidators, and creditors. It should also be read by the independent retailer across the road whose competitor might be about to hand back their keys

**TITLE:** Shopify Cohort × ONS Wages × Local IMD → LTV Segmentation (Retail)
**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Shopify order history (customer acquisition date, customer postcode, channel attribution, order frequency, AOV)
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) — median earnings by postcode district; English Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019 by LSOA; ONS population estimates
**FUSION LOGIC:** Assign each customer cohort an "area affluence index" using postcode IMD decile and median ASHE wage; segment LTV curves by affluence decile; identify: (a) affluent-postcode customers with low LTV — under-served segment; (b) lower-affluence cohorts driving disproportionate revenue — retention priority; (c) channel efficiency by geographic wealth band
**INSIGHT:** LTV segmentation by postcode affluence reveals which acquisition channels are over-investing in low-LTV segments; redistributing Meta/Google ad spend toward postcode clusters with high-affluence + high-LTV correlation can improve blended LTV by 15–25% with no budget increase
**ACTION:** Postcode-level LTV segmentation updated quarterly; meta/Google ad audience exclusions and inclusions adjusted to favour high-LTV postcode clusters; personalise loyalty rewards by income proxy segment (GDPR note: aggregate-level only, never individual profiling)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£40,000/yr incremental LTV improvement (15–25% improvement on customer acquisition efficiency on a £200k annual customer acquisition budget)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Customer cohort analysis; LTV:CAC ratio optimisation; Fader & Hardie BG/NBD model
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** ONS ASHE publishes median weekly earnings by postcode district. The difference between buying habits in NE2 (Jesmond, median earnings £38k) and NE5 (Newburn, median earnings £24k) is structural. A Shopify retailer that treats both postcodes identically is spending acquisition budget with no regard for return

**INTERNAL DATA:** Klaviyo/Meta campaign spend by week; conversion rate; revenue attributed by channel; weekly search impressions from Google Search Console
**PUBLIC DATA:** Google Trends API (interest by region, keyword, time period — free); Google Search Console (click data for own site)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Overlay weekly Google Trends interest score for key category terms (e.g., "gifts for her", "mountain bike", "vintage fashion") in catchment region against own ad spend efficiency (revenue/£ spent); identify periods of organic demand surge (pre-Christmas, Valentine's, bank holidays) where paid spend achieves 2–3× efficiency premium, and periods of trough where spend should be minimised
**INSIGHT:** Paid advertising achieves 2–3× normal efficiency during confirmed organic demand surge periods; distributing budget evenly across the year misallocates £ toward low-efficiency periods; pulsing budget to demand spikes can improve blended ROAS by 15–25% with no budget increase
**ACTION:** Dynamic ad budget calendar that pulses spend up during confirmed demand spikes; use Google Trends as the trigger for budget reallocation decisions; redirect trough-period budget to Klaviyo email retention flows (typically 3–5× better ROI than cold acquisition)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£25,000/yr ROAS improvement (15–25% blended ROAS improvement on a £100k annual paid media budget)

**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Inventory variance records (book stock vs counted stock); shrinkage write-off log; CCTV event timestamps (motion detection/person detected); till exception reports (voids, refunds, no-sales)
**PUBLIC DATA:** data.police.uk API — street-level crime by lat/lon and date, including "shoplifting" category (free, no registration required); UK Crime Survey annual statistics
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build weekly shrinkage vs crime-rate regression for store location and surrounding streets; when police.uk data shows a spike in shoplifting reports within 500m (typically 2–3 month lag due to reporting), pre-position loss-prevention response; cross-reference CCTV motion logs to identify high-activity time windows; correlate till exception anomalies with CCTV timestamps for internal theft detection
**INSIGHT:** UK retailers hitting 1.68% shrink on a £500k store = £8,400/year lost; local crime rate spikes from police.uk data predict elevated shoplifting 2–3 months ahead, enabling pre-emptive loss-prevention positioning
**ACTION:** Weekly police.uk data pull for store catchment area; alert when shoplifting reports rise >30% vs trailing 12-week average; review CCTV footage for identified high-risk windows; report internal theft anomalies using established till exception protocol
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £1,680–£4,200/yr (20–50% reduction in £8,400 shrink baseline on a £500k store)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Statistical Process Control (anomaly detection on till exceptions); Benford's Law (internal fraud detection); crime geography analysis

**TITLE:** Marketplace Fee Leakage × FBA Storage Ageing × Demand Signals (Retail)
**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Amazon Seller Central FBA inventory age report; ASIN-level sales velocity; storage fee invoices; returns processing fees; own-website margin by equivalent product
**PUBLIC DATA:** Amazon fee schedules (published); ONS consumer goods price index; Google Trends demand signal for product category; Bank of England inflation tracker
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each ASIN: calculate true net margin after all FBA fees (fulfilment, monthly storage, aged-inventory surcharge at 271+ days, returns processing fee); compare to own-website margin for the same product; identify "fee inversion" ASINs where marketplace net margin has fallen below own-site margin; apply demand signals to choose between: (a) liquidation via sale, (b) removal, (c) FBM shift, (d) price increase
**INSIGHT:** Typical finding: 20–30% of FBA catalogue is at negative or near-zero true margin after fees; Amazon's 2024 fee escalation has pushed many mid-priced products below break-even without sellers knowing; fee audit and triage typically recovers 3–5% of marketplace revenue as margin
**ACTION:** Quarterly FBA fee audit; remove or liquidate all ASINs with net margin below 5% after fees; build a fee-inversion model that auto-alerts when a fee change pushes an ASIN below threshold; initiate own-site SEO push for fee-inverted products
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £6,000–£15,000/yr (3–5% marketplace revenue recovery on a £300k annual FBA channel)

**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** SKU-level sales; basket composition; date/time; channel; product hierarchy (category → sub-category → SKU)
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Household spending data by category; Retail Economics category trend data
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a directed cross-sell graph: node = product category; edge weight = co-purchase frequency above random baseline (lift >1.0); identify negative edges (category pairs with below-random co-purchase — cannibalisation signal); validate against ONS category spend trends; if ONS shows overall category spend rising but own share is flat, cannibalisation within own range is suppressing capture
**INSIGHT:** Cannibalisation within a product range is the most common cause of flat revenue in a growing category; two similar products competing within the same range reduce the capture of customers who would have bought one of them exclusively; the co-purchase graph reveals the cannibalisation pairs invisible in aggregate revenue data
**ACTION:** Rationalise cannibalising sub-categories; promote high-lift cross-sell pairs through bundling, product placement, and Klaviyo "frequently bought together" flows; discontinue bottom-20% by lift score if cannibalisation with top-20% is confirmed
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£25,000/yr incremental revenue (range rationalisation improving category capture efficiency by 5–10%)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House accounts data for each UK-registered supplier; Gazette winding-up petitions for supplier companies; HMRC trade data for country-of-origin risk
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate supplier concentration (top-3 suppliers as % of COGS — equivalent of Herfindahl index for supply base); for each major supplier with UK Companies House registration, run simplified financial health check (Piotroski F-Score proxies: current ratio, gearing, accounts filing compliance); flag suppliers with accounts >6 months overdue or negative equity
**INSIGHT:** Where a single supplier represents >40% of COGS, any disruption to that relationship is existential; UK construction insolvencies hit 3,950 in 2026 — the same financial stress affects retail supplier businesses; a key supplier in financial distress typically gives 6–9 months of warning in Companies House filings
**ACTION:** Where top supplier >40% of COGS: immediately qualify secondary source; Gazette API auto-alert for all suppliers >10% of COGS; add supplier financial health to annual procurement review
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£100,000 protected (preventing a major supply disruption event that causes a single-season stockout and margin collapse)

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS "Impact of Higher Energy Costs on UK Businesses" (quarterly average non-domestic electricity prices); Ofgem non-domestic tariff comparison data; ONS sub-national energy consumption statistics (BEIS/DESNZ — regional SMB energy use)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate energy-cost-per-transaction: total monthly £ energy ÷ monthly transaction count; benchmark against ONS average non-domestic electricity price to assess whether current tariff is above-market; track trend — as transaction count falls and fixed energy costs remain, energy-cost-per-transaction rises as structural headwind; flag when rising faster than margin can absorb
**INSIGHT:** Non-domestic electricity is still 75% above pre-surge levels at 25.97p/kWh in Q4 2024; a store paying 28p/kWh vs market rate 22p/kWh on 120,000 kWh/yr is overpaying £7,200/yr; energy-cost-per-transaction rising faster than margin is an early warning of operating leverage working against the business
**ACTION:** Annual tariff review against Ofgem non-domestic benchmarks; smart meter installation for time-of-use optimisation; identify time-of-use tariff savings (lighting, heating off-peak loading)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,600–£10,000/yr (tariff switching + smart meter optimisation on a store spending £2,500/month on energy)

**PUBLIC DATA:** English IMD 2019 by LSOA/postcode; Police.uk shoplifting data by postcode district
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build return-anomaly model at customer account level (not postcode level): flagging serial returners (>40% of purchases returned), returns within 24 hours (wardrobing), returns of items with evidence of use; at aggregate postcode level only — use to inform policy design (e.g., reduced return window for high-value items in specific channels), never individual credit decisions
**INSIGHT:** UK online return fraud costs retailers an estimated £1.8bn annually; photo-evidence requirements for returns reduces fraud rate by 15–25% in tested implementations; ethical framing is non-negotiable: individual profiling by postcode is both illegal and inaccurate
**ACTION:** Stricter return authentication for high-value items in high-risk channels; photo-evidence requirement for online returns; serial returner account review (aggregate pattern, not individual profiling)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £2,000–£8,000/yr (15–25% reduction in fraud-related returns on a £500k online store with 2% fraud rate = £5,000 at risk)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Statistical anomaly detection; ICO guidance on automated decision-making; forensic retail analytics

**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Consumer Price Index (for real-spend deflation); ONS Retail Sales Index (sector benchmarks for purchase frequency); UK Loyalty Programs Intelligence Report (UK market worth $9.02bn in 2024, growing at 10.2% annually)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Construct a difference-in-differences analysis: enrolled loyalty members vs propensity-score-matched non-members (matched on: first-purchase date, channel, category, geography); measure incremental purchase frequency, average order value, 12-month LTV, retention rate; control for macro (ONS CPI/retail index) to separate program effect from market tailwind
**INSIGHT:** Members who redeem spend 3.1× more and generate 12–18% more incremental revenue annually than non-members; however, many loyalty programs show zero incremental LTV when properly controlled — the program selects already-loyal customers rather than creating loyalty; control-group analysis is the only way to tell the difference
**ACTION:** Run control-group analysis before expanding loyalty investment; if LTV increment is <1× program cost, restructure toward cashback (UK consumer preference) rather than points; if >2×, accelerate investment in loyalty infrastructure
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£30,000/yr incremental LTV (if program ROI is validated; zero or negative if program is merely selecting rather than creating loyalty)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Difference-in-differences causal inference; Fader & Hardie BG/NBD model; Reichheld retention economics
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.3.m

**PUBLIC DATA:** Google Trends category interest (free); ONS retail sales by category (demand proxy); SEMrush/Ahrefs competitor PLA data (commercial, widely used)
**FUSION LOGIC:** When Google Ads impression share falls on a keyword cluster without a corresponding drop in budget, a competitor has entered or increased bids; ONS retail sales data validates whether that category is structurally growing (market-level demand) or declining (defend or retreat decision); track "impression share lost to rank" vs "lost to budget" — different remedies; compute optimal bid reallocation using ROAS-maximising portfolio model
**INSIGHT:** Impression share lost to rank (quality score problem) requires creative/landing page improvement; impression share lost to budget requires budget reallocation; conflating the two misallocates remediation effort; ONS retail sales data confirms whether a category is worth defending or conceding
**ACTION:** Re-bid on high-share-of-voice, high-ROAS campaigns first; pause low-ROAS, low-impression-share campaigns; redirect saved spend to Klaviyo retention flows (3–5× better ROI for repeat-purchase categories)

**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Semantic
**INTERNAL DATA:** SKU-level return log with reason codes; customer review text timestamped by product and variant
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply BERTopic topic modelling weekly on reviews per SKU cluster; when a new topic cluster emerges (e.g. "seam splitting", "colour different from photo") with >5 review instances and average sentiment below -0.4, cross-reference against return log for that SKU; if return rate has not yet spiked but the topic has emerged, this is a 2–4 week leading indicator of a return spike
**INSIGHT:** Review text detects quality issues before customers who did not review simply start returning silently; this is a 2–4 week leading indicator of return spikes with near-zero additional data collection cost
**ACTION:** Automated weekly SKU quality alert; contact supplier immediately when topic cluster emerges; investigate batch quality before dispatching remaining inventory
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £5,000–£9,000 per defective batch detected early (preventing all 200 units dispatching: £25/return processing × 200 units = £5,000 handling alone, before margin on replacement stock)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)

**TYPE:** Semantic
**INTERNAL DATA:** Gorgias ticket history per customer (sentiment per ticket, resolution time, topic); Shopify order history per customer (cohort, purchase frequency, days-since-last-order, LTV)
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply ABSA on ticket text; identify customers who: (1) have made ≥3 purchases (valuable cohort), AND (2) whose most recent support ticket shows negative ABSA sentiment toward "returns process" or "delivery", AND (3) whose days-since-last-order is trending 20% longer than historical inter-purchase interval; this triple conjunction produces a pre-churn score
**INSIGHT:** Customers do not suddenly churn; they disengage across 3 dimensions simultaneously before leaving; the triple conjunction (negative sentiment + long inter-purchase interval + recent support friction) has an estimated 65–75% predictive accuracy for 60-day churn
**ACTION:** Automated Klaviyo flow triggered by pre-churn score >0.7: personalised "we want to get this right" email from founder, with specific offer tied to the ticket topic (free returns on next order if complaint was about return cost)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £6,000/yr (retaining 30% of triggered customers at £180 annual LTV: 50 at-risk customers/month × 30% retention × £120/yr = £1,800/month × partial year activation)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Customer survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier on inter-purchase intervals); ABSA sentiment trajectory; Zuora subscription economy churn research
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.2.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** A retained cohort-3+ customer with £180 annual LTV costs ~£40 to reacquire if lost. A personalised intervention email costs £0.003 to send. The ROI on a pre-churn email that retains 30% of triggered customers is several hundred times the send cost. The only reason this is not universally deployed is that most retailers never built the ABSA pipeline to detect the signal

**PUBLIC DATA:** Competitor product listings for equivalent items (from Amazon, Etsy, Google Shopping results — gathered within platform ToS for research purposes)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Sentence-transformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via Ollama — lightweight, runs on any client hardware) to encode own and competitor product descriptions; compute cosine similarity between own listing and the cluster centroid of competitor listings for the same category; if cosine similarity <0.65, flag as "relevance gap"; extract semantic territory where competitors cluster that own listing misses
**INSIGHT:** High cosine distance on a high-revenue SKU is a listing optimisation gap; customers search using language your listing doesn't contain; Google Shopping relevance score improves when listing vocabulary aligns with verified customer language from review text
**ACTION:** Rewrite flagged product descriptions to close the semantic gap using competitor vocabulary and customer review language; this is not keyword stuffing — it is aligning listing vocabulary with verified customer language; A/B test rewrites against original on Google Shopping
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £4,500/yr incremental revenue (15% improvement in Google Shopping conversion rate on £3,000/month spend driving £30,000 revenue = £4,500 incremental for same budget)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Hard (1–3 months)

**VERTICAL:** Retail
**TYPE:** Semantic
**INTERNAL DATA:** WhatsApp Business API message threads or Gorgias live-chat transcripts; subsequent Shopify purchase behaviour for those customers
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Apply transformer-based sentiment at turn level (each message in a conversation) rather than conversation level; produce sentiment trajectory; classify conversation arcs: (1) Resolution arc — customer arrived upset, left satisfied; (2) Plateau — neutral throughout; (3) Decline arc — customer arrived with question, left frustrated; correlate arc type against subsequent repurchase rate; deploy Hidden Markov Model or LSTM for arc classification in real-time
**INSIGHT:** Resolution arc customers repurchase at materially higher rate than Decline arc customers; in some retail categories, a well-resolved complaint produces higher LTV than a customer who never complained (service recovery paradox); measuring at turn level allows real-time intervention when a conversation is on a Decline arc
**ACTION:** Real-time alert when a conversation is on a Decline arc (agent sees warning, can intervene); post-conversation routing (send follow-up satisfaction micro-survey to Decline arc conversations only); agent performance scoring by arc-outcome distribution
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £6,000/yr (10% of Decline arc customers flipped to Resolution arc through real-time alerts: 50/month × £120/yr incremental LTV × 10% recovery rate)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Map firm's practice areas to SIC codes; track Companies House formation/dissolution rates in those sectors quarterly; a surge in company formations in "Information and communication" signals demand growth for IT contracting/employment law; a collapse in construction formations predicts falling conveyancing volume 3–6 months ahead; overlay against current utilisation to identify capacity mismatches
**INSIGHT:** ONS Business Demography data is a 3–6 month leading indicator of demand by practice area; for accountancy firms with technology clients, the formation rate in SIC 62/63 is a pipeline leading indicator; for construction-sector conveyancers, dissolution rate is the most important signal
**ACTION:** Quarterly practice area capacity review using sector formation/dissolution data; rebalance capacity allocation before demand changes hit revenue; flag underutilised practice areas for active BD redirection

**TITLE:** WIP Ageing × Altman Z Client Signals → Bad-Debt Prevention (ProfServices)
**VERTICAL:** ProfServices
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** WIP ledger by matter and client (age, value, payment history); outstanding invoices by client; write-off history by client
**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House accounts for each significant business client (extract: current ratio, gearing, net assets, profit/loss trend); Gazette winding-up petitions for client companies
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each corporate client with >£5k WIP or outstanding invoices, calculate a simplified Altman Z'' proxy from Companies House accounts (working capital/total assets, EBIT/total assets, retained earnings/total assets, equity/total liabilities); Z'' < 1.1 signals distress zone; combine with days-outstanding; alert: WIP age >60 days AND client Z-score in distress zone → immediate billing and collection escalation
**INSIGHT:** UK firms write off ~20% of WIP; a WIP/Z-score triage system could reduce write-off rate by 25–30% for corporate clients; a client who files Companies House accounts 6 months late with negative equity is the same client who will dispute your invoice in month 8
**ACTION:** Monthly WIP/Z-score review for all clients >£5k WIP; immediate billing and collection escalation for amber/red accounts; stop building WIP for clients in distress zone until payment is received
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £100,000–£200,000/yr (reducing WIP write-off from 20% to 15% on a £2m annual WIP: £100k protected)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z'' Score (financial distress prediction); cash conversion cycle; activity-based costing applied to professional services billing
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.2.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Credit insurers (Euler Hermes) decline cover on clients whose Companies House filings show Z'' in the distress zone. A professional services firm that continues billing into a distress-zone client is underwriting the same risk for free — without any premium

**PUBLIC DATA:** LinkedIn company data (industry, headcount, location, growth signals — via LinkedIn Sales Navigator or public profile); Companies House company search; ICAEW/Law Society referral guidelines
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a referral graph: node = client or referral source; edge weight = referral frequency and revenue generated; identify referral hubs (single introducers responsible for >3 matters); cross-reference with LinkedIn firmographics to identify underserved sectors and high-ROI referral sources; identify referral gaps (e.g., IFA firm not receiving referrals from local accountant network)
**INSIGHT:** 60–70% of professional services revenue is referral-driven; a 10% improvement in referral volume from existing sources has 2–3× the ROI of new channel marketing; most professional services firms do not map their referral graph explicitly, so the most productive relationships are invisible to management
**ACTION:** BD targeting matrix identifying the 10 highest-ROI referral relationships to invest in quarterly; assign senior partner account management to top-5 referral hubs; quarterly BD review focused exclusively on referral graph deepening
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£80,000/yr incremental revenue (10% improvement in referral volume at £300k average annual referral-driven revenue for a mid-size firm)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**TITLE:** Email Response Time × Client Retention Curves (ProfServices)
**VERTICAL:** ProfServices
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Email metadata (inbound timestamp, outbound response timestamp, client ID) — via Microsoft 365 mailbox analytics or equivalent; client churn/departure dates; retention rates by fee-earner
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required (pure internal analysis); benchmark: professional services clients expect <4 hour response during business hours
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate average response time by client using email threading; segment clients by response time band: <2hrs, 2–8hrs, 8–24hrs, >24hrs; run survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier curve) on client retention by response-time segment; test hypothesis: clients in >24hr segment have materially shorter retention and lower LTV
**INSIGHT:** In professional services, email response time is one of the strongest predictors of client retention; clients in the >24hr response segment show 2–3× higher voluntary departure hazard than <2hr segment in service industry research; the response time data is almost universally available but almost universally unanalysed
**ACTION:** Automate an acknowledgement response for any client email not responded to within 2 business hours; identify fee-earners with systematically high response times as a workload and training intervention point; set firm-wide response time SLA and measure weekly
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£50,000/yr protected (preventing 1–2 client departures per year attributable to poor response times, at £10,000–£25,000 average annual fees per client)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; customer service SLA management; Reichheld retention economics
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.-.1.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Amazon's customer service SLA (24-hour response requirement for marketplace sellers) is backed by the empirical finding that response time is the single highest-correlating predictor of repeat purchase. In professional services, the same relationship holds: clients who wait >24 hours for a response behave exactly like customers who received poor Amazon delivery service

**PUBLIC DATA:** FCA Handbook update feed; HMRC Tax Information and Impact Notes (TIINs); MTD Making Tax Digital implementation schedule; ICO guidance updates; SRA and ICAEW regulatory changes
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a client-exposure matrix: for each regulatory change, identify which clients in the book are materially affected; score exposure by: (a) how many clients, (b) current engagement depth, (c) competitor coverage; produce a "regulatory demand forecast" — number of clients likely requiring advisory work on each upcoming change in the next 6 months
**INSIGHT:** Regulatory changes are the most predictable and durable source of professional services demand; for accountancy firms, MTD for ITSA (phased from April 2026) is the single largest upcoming regulatory demand driver; a systematic mapping of the client book against MTD exposure identifies which clients need urgent onboarding into quarterly digital filing workflows
**ACTION:** Quarterly regulatory demand forecast published to all fee-earners; proactive outreach to exposed clients 3–6 months before a regulatory deadline (positions firm as trusted advisor and generates fee-earning conversations ahead of competitors)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £30,000–£80,000/yr (systematic MTD advisory on 50 affected clients × £600–£1,600 average advisory fee per client per year)

**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Timesheet data (hours by matter by week); matter budget vs actual hours (from practice management system); meeting logs; email volume by matter per week
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required (internal pattern recognition using historical matter data)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Train a regression or simple decision-tree model: dependent variable = write-off % at matter close; independent variables = ratio of week-2 hours to budget, email volume growth rate week-over-week (from Outlook analytics), number of distinct fee-earners touching matter, matter type; matters showing >20% budget consumption in week 1 with accelerating email volume are historically highest write-off risk
**INSIGHT:** 39% of legal matters and a similar proportion of accountancy matters experience scope creep; catching it at 60% of budget allows a fee conversation; catching it at 95% means a write-off; the early warning signals are in timesheet and email data
**ACTION:** Trigger a mid-matter scope review conversation when model flags >60% probability of write-off: "We're at 45% of your budget and want to discuss scope." Preventive scope conversation recovers the matter; reactive write-off does not
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £80,000–£120,000/yr (semantic scope-creep detection catching 30% of scope-driven write-offs: 30% × 20% write-off rate × £2m annual WIP)

**PUBLIC DATA:** LinkedIn profile data (career history, tenure signals); Companies House director appointment/resignation filings for the firm; ONS workforce ageing statistics
**FUSION LOGIC:** Score each partner on: (a) estimated years to retirement; (b) percentage of firm revenue they originate; (c) client relationship breadth (do clients know multiple partners or just them?); (d) succession plan in place (HR system); calculate revenue-at-risk = origination credits × probability of departure within 5 years × probability of client following (historically 40–70% of clients follow a departing originating partner at smaller firms)
**INSIGHT:** Only 25% of UK professional services firms have a formal succession plan; a firm where 60%+ of origination credits sit with partners aged 57–63, with no formal succession plan and clients who deal exclusively with those individuals, faces a revenue cliff within 5 years; revenue-at-risk is routinely £200k–£800k for a small firm

**VERTICAL:** ProfServices
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Fee income by client; matter type distribution; client retention history
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS sector-level revenue data (as context benchmark); UK Finance guidance on HHI application
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate client HHI for the firm: HHI = Σ(revenue share of each client)²; HHI near 0 = highly diversified; HHI near 10,000 = monopoly concentration; industry rule of thumb: HHI above 2,500 = high concentration risk; track trend quarterly; segment by practice area
**INSIGHT:** A firm where top-5 clients = 60% of revenue (common in SMB professional services) has HHI ~1,800–2,400 — borderline dangerous; each large client lost represents a >10% revenue cliff that cannot be recovered within a quarter; revenue concentration is the most common structural risk factor in professional services insolvency
**ACTION:** HHI dashboard with threshold alert when concentration rises; new client acquisition KPI weighted to reduce concentration; minimum 30 active clients across practice areas as structural target
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** Business resilience: preventing one major client loss event (10–15% revenue cliff) from causing insolvency

**PUBLIC DATA:** Competitors' published fee guides (some UK law firms publish indicative rates); Clio Legal Trends Report (average billing rates by practice area, UK edition); ONS producer price index for professional services
**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress win rate against quoted fee (residualised for matter complexity proxies: matter type, client size, urgency); the slope of the residual win-rate vs quoted-fee relationship gives implied fee elasticity; if win rate is insensitive to fee above a floor, price power exists; if win rate drops precipitously above a threshold, the market clearing price is known
**INSIGHT:** Most professional services firms have implicit pricing assumptions that have never been tested empirically; many are operating with significant untapped pricing power in retained/complex work while over-pricing commodity work; a 5% fee increase on retained work where win rate is >80% is pure margin addition
**ACTION:** Evidence-based pricing authority: raise fees in inelastic zones; offer fixed-fee certainty in elastic zones; annual fee review using win-rate residual analysis; publish a pricing authority matrix so fee-earners know where they can and cannot vary from standard rates
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £45,000/yr (5% pricing power on 60% of retained work at £1.5m billing)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Law Society benchmarking data (sector average recovery rates); Armstrong Watson benchmarking survey data (2024/25: average UK law firm recovery at £748 per £1,000 billed)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Run ANOVA on recovery rates by fee-earner, controlling for matter type and client sector; identify fee-earners with systematically below-median recovery; diagnose whether: (a) they are assigned more write-off-prone matters, (b) they over-record time, (c) they fail to bill in full, or (d) they carry relationship-discount pressure from partners
**INSIGHT:** UK law firm average recovery of £748 per £1,000 billed is already poor; firms below £700 per £1,000 are in distress territory; fee-earner recovery variance is typically ±15–25% around the mean — the most recoverable single lever in professional services profitability
**ACTION:** Fee-earner recovery league table with statistical significance flags; below-median recovery performers receive coaching, matter-type reassignment, or billing review protocols
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £75,000/yr (5pp improvement in recovery rate across a £1.5m fee-income firm)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor HMCTS/CourtServe for cases where firm clients appear as parties; monitor employment tribunal decisions for clients in sectors with high employment dispute rates; pre-emptively identify when a client has active litigation (a) as collection risk for outstanding invoices and (b) as new engagement opportunity for litigation support
**INSIGHT:** Clients appearing as defendants in court have dramatically higher WIP collection risk; clients appearing in employment tribunals represent cross-sell opportunities for employment law advice; CourtServe turns public court data into both a risk management and a business development feed
**ACTION:** Weekly CourtServe monitoring for all clients with >£5k outstanding WIP; immediate escalation of invoice collection when a corporate debtor appears in court listings; proactive outreach with litigation support offering when client appears as defendant

**INSIGHT:** Cross-sell from existing client base requires zero acquisition cost; referral conversion rate in legal is 3.6% for warm referrals but much higher for existing client cross-sell; the top-5 temporal pathways predict which additional services a client is likely to need — and the optimal time to introduce them
**ACTION:** Systematic cross-sell campaign: for all clients who closed an employment matter in the past 18 months and have not engaged on HR policy work, send a targeted note; assign cross-sell tracking to fee-earners with existing relationship
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£40,000/yr (25 cross-sell engagements from a 200-client firm using temporal pathway analysis × £600–£1,600 average fee)

**FUSION LOGIC:** Score each open matter on a PII risk matrix: (1) matter type risk weight; (2) matter value (claims increase sharply above £100k); (3) complexity signals (>5 drafting iterations, >3 fee-earners, duration >2× estimate); (4) client sector risk; high-risk matter clusters trigger mandatory QC review
**INSIGHT:** Conveyancing represents 50% of SRA indemnity payments by value; PII already costs small firms 5.1% of fee income; reducing claims frequency by 20% through risk-weighted matter review could save £20,000+ in premium on a firm with £500k annual fee income

**INSIGHT:** 39% of legal matters experience scope creep; better engagement letter terms are the structural fix; the regression typically reveals that matters with an explicit scope-change protocol have write-off rates 30–50% below those without; the intervention costs zero — it is a document change
**ACTION:** Standard engagement letter upgrade: mandatory scope-change notification clause, monthly billing cycle for matters >£2k, upfront deposits for all new clients; measure write-off rate change 6 months post-implementation

**FUSION LOGIC:** Plot 52-week capacity demand curve using historical patterns (January = peak for Self Assessment, April = year-end rush, September/October = accounts filing season); overlay with current open-matter volume to project future capacity crunch weeks; identify weeks where committed demand exceeds 90% of available capacity
**INSIGHT:** January 31 SA deadline creates a structural annual crunch that firms failing to map 6 weeks in advance consistently handle with avoidable overtime and near-misses; firms that plan ahead stagger client deadlines, use surplus windows for training, and hire contractors before — not during — peaks

**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor competitor LinkedIn job postings for patterns: volume of associate-level postings = competitor growth signal; postings in specific practice areas = market opportunity signal; track own associate churn rate and benchmark against sector; when own churn rises above 25% and competitor hiring is elevated, compensation benchmarking exercise triggered
**INSIGHT:** Professional services sector average associate churn is 15–25%/year; above 25% signals a compensation or culture problem; LinkedIn postings by competitors are a real-time signal of their growth trajectory — a competitor hiring 5 associates in 3 months is capacity-constrained and likely taking more work than they can service, creating a poaching opportunity

**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Staff
**INTERNAL DATA:** Google/Trustpilot review text; call transcript segments mentioning staff names; CRM notes; 28-day and 90-day rolling windows per named staff member
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** ABSA with staff name as target aspect via spaCy NER + GLiNER; extract sentences containing the staff name, score sentiment toward that aspect; compute rolling mean per staff member; flag when 28-day mean drops >0.8 SD below 90-day baseline, or when three negative aspect-mentions appear within any 14-day window
**INSIGHT:** Staff-specific complaint accumulation fires 4–8 weeks before formal HR escalation or public review damage; the signal distinguishes a genuinely underperforming staff member from an isolated bad interaction via independent corroboration requirement
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Three reviews this month mentioned Dave — all around arrival time. His previous scores were strong. Worth a quiet word before it shows up more publicly." — prompts coaching conversation before performance management is required
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £2,000–£15,000/yr (preventing one bad-review cascade and associated revenue loss; preventing one HR dispute)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Lexicon count of apology and reparation language tokens (sorry, apologies, unfortunately, regret, inconvenience, we should have, that's not good enough) normalised by total outbound message volume per week; PELT changepoint detection on the weekly density time series; flag when density rises >2× baseline sustained over 2+ weeks
**INSIGHT:** A rising apology token density from 0.8% to 2.6% of outbound message words over six weeks, with PELT-identified changepoint correlating to a new supplier's first delivery batch, is the operational diagnosis of a supply problem before formal complaints arrive
**ACTION:** When apology density rises, immediately investigate the triggering event: new supplier, new process, new staff member, new product; resolve at root cause rather than managing the customer sentiment downstream
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £5,000–£20,000/yr (early root-cause identification prevents review score decline and customer attrition)

**INSIGHT:** A quote writer whose hedge density rises from 2.1% to 8.4% of content words with a corresponding win-rate drop from 68% to 41% (r = -0.73) has a confidence problem, not a pricing problem — the intervention is coaching, not repricing
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Tom's recent quotes have a lot of uncertain language — phrases like 'roughly' and 'we'd hope to'. This might be costing him work. Would a quote template review help?" — prompts targeted communication coaching

**INSIGHT:** A supplier relationship where correspondence sentiment has shifted from +0.31 to -0.18 over 60 days with rising formality and three delivery complaints is at risk of deteriorating terms, supply disruption, or price increase before the next renewal
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Your correspondence with Primary Plumbing Supplies has become more formal and less positive recently — there seem to be delivery issues. Worth a call before it affects your next order." — prompts proactive supplier relationship management

**INSIGHT:** Internal Slack message negative sentiment rising from 12% to 31% of messages over 28 days with team-wide distribution (not individual-concentrated) is a systemic process failure signal, not a staff wellbeing problem — the intervention is process investigation, not performance management
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Internal messages this month have more frustrated language than usual — this seems team-wide rather than one person. Could be worth a check-in about workflow." — prompts structured process investigation with team
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£50,000/yr (prevented staff turnover from unaddressed operational frustration)

**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level + punctuation informality markers per customer thread; compare current 30-day register to 90-day baseline; register drop with positive sentiment = relationship warming (referral signal); register drop with negative sentiment shift = passive-aggressive pre-escalation signal — the two patterns require opposite interventions
**INSIGHT:** The same linguistic event (register drop) signals either a referral opportunity (customer now trusts you enough to write casually) or an escalation precursor (customer has given up on formality and is transitioning to complaint mode) — distinguishing them requires concurrent sentiment direction
**ACTION:** Positive signal: "Mark's communication style has become much more relaxed — this would be a good time for a referral conversation." Negative signal: "Sarah's messages have become short and a bit pointed — worth a proactive call before it becomes a formal complaint."
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £2,000–£10,000/yr (2–3 referrals captured per year from positive signal; 1–2 complaints de-escalated from negative signal)

**INSIGHT:** A customer who asked 0.4 questions per email now asking 2.8 per email, clustering around delivery timing and materials quality, has lost confidence in project progression — the questions are a visible symptom of eroding trust that predates a formal complaint by 2–4 weeks
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Helen has been asking a lot more questions than usual — particularly about timing and materials. She might need some reassurance about the project status." — prompts proactive status update call

**INSIGHT:** An invoice note reading "Amount queried by client — said price wasn't what was discussed. Awaiting response." (VADER compound -0.61) is an open dispute that if unresolved becomes a churn event, negative review, or formal claim; detecting it the same day it is written compresses the resolution window from weeks to hours

**FUSION LOGIC:** Gratitude lexicon density (thank you, thanks so much, really appreciate, brilliant, fantastic job, you've been amazing) per 100 inbound customer message words; track at individual customer level and aggregate to portfolio-level trend; high individual density = rebook/referral candidate; firm-level decline = relationship-quality erosion signal
**INSIGHT:** Firm-level thank-you density dropping from 3.4 to 1.1 per 100 message-words over a quarter, concurrent with a new pricing tier rollout, is diagnostic evidence that the pricing change has damaged the emotional relationship — a leading indicator of churn before it appears in renewal rates
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Customer appreciation language has dropped significantly this quarter — sometimes follows a price change. Worth checking how customers are responding to the new rates." — prompts pricing sensitivity investigation
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,000–£15,000/yr (retention intervention triggered 6–8 weeks earlier than churn data would reveal)

**INSIGHT:** A customer who has communicated casually for four months and sends "I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction... I would appreciate a written response within 5 working days" (grade 14.2 vs baseline 7.3) has initiated a pre-legal escalation sequence; calling them within the hour has a dramatically higher de-escalation success rate than calling them in three days
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Sarah's just sent a message that sounds like the beginning of a formal complaint — significant shift from how she normally writes. Do you want to call her now, before it goes further?" — prompts immediate phone contact

**INSIGHT:** 34% of calls ending without resolution language (vs 8% industry best practice for trades SMBs) means customers are hanging up uncertain about next steps — this drives re-call rates, complaint rates, and lower satisfaction scores; the pattern is detectable in near-real-time from transcripts
**ACTION:** Agent line: "About a third of your calls this week ended without any clear 'here's what happens next' — want me to show you the specific calls?" — enables targeted staff coaching with evidence

**INSIGHT:** A team meeting with 14 interruptions per 10 minutes (vs baseline 3), all involving the same two speakers, with the interrupted speaker's subsequent sentiment dropping to -0.42, is exhibiting low psychological safety — predictive of higher error rates, reduced information sharing, and staff turnover
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Last week's team meeting had a notably high interruption rate — one conversation in particular seemed quite tense. This might be worth addressing outside the meeting context." — prompts one-to-one facilitated conversation

**INSIGHT:** Mean time-to-apology of 4.2 days with 38% of apologies scoring negative in content despite surface-level "sorry" language is a service recovery failure at scale; the service recovery paradox (Hart, Heskett & Sasser) only activates when the response is rapid and genuine — measuring both speed and quality enables intervention on both dimensions simultaneously
**ACTION:** Standard complaint response protocol: acknowledge within 2 hours, resolve within 24 hours; apology template review to shift from defensive to empathetic register; agent alerts fire the moment a complaint message is detected with no response within 90 minutes

**FUSION LOGIC:** Track new hire's internal message sentiment, message frequency, vocabulary diversity (asking questions, sharing ideas?), and response-received rate (are colleagues engaging?); compare to anonymised onboarding curve baseline from previous hires at the same business; flag when trajectory deviates negatively from expected onboarding curve at weeks 4, 7, 12
**INSIGHT:** A new hire in week 7 with 43% fewer internal messages than week-2 peak, declining sentiment from +0.41 to +0.08, and 30% fewer colleague replies than the average new hire at equivalent tenure is exhibiting an isolation reinforcing loop — invisible to standard probationary review processes

**INSIGHT:** Management-tier internal sentiment at +0.38 vs staff-tier at -0.19 (gap = 0.57, up from 0.12 three months ago) indicates managers are increasingly positive/motivational while staff are increasingly exhausted — the asymmetry is a burnout precursor that managers genuinely do not perceive because they only see their own messaging
**ACTION:** Agent line: "There's a noticeable gap between how management-level messages are sounding and how the rest of the team is sounding — sometimes precedes staff turnover. Worth a candid team conversation?" — prompts owner-initiated team dialogue

**INSIGHT:** Staff messages at 4.8 gratitude/effort tokens per 100 words vs customer messages at 0.9 (ratio 5.3) indicates sustained asymmetric emotional labour — the signal typically appears in high-volume service environments (hospitality, beauty, trades customer-facing roles) where staff investment is structurally higher than customer reciprocity

**INSIGHT:** A lead sales person's first-response emails dropping from 180-word +0.42 sentiment average to 62-word +0.11 sentiment over six weeks is exhibiting workload pressure affecting first impressions — the Kahneman peak-end rule makes the first contact disproportionately determinative of the overall relationship perception

**INSIGHT:** 31% of post-job messages from customers served by Emma contain spontaneous rebook language vs 11% firm average — sustained over 6 months — identifies Emma as a relationship asset whose practices should be studied and replicated across the team
**ACTION:** Agent line: "Emma's customers are significantly more likely to say they'll be back or recommend her than anyone else. Worth understanding what she does differently." — prompts qualitative investigation and practice-sharing session
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £4,000–£15,000/yr (replication of high-rebook practices across team increases referral pipeline without marketing spend)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Reichheld NPS (intent-to-recommend as upstream referral behaviour); organic loyalty measurement without survey fatigue; staff benchmarking
**PUDDING LABEL:** S.+.2.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Yelp Elite reviewer research: restaurant industry analysts found that certain servers generate disproportionate 5-star reviews and return visits — not because of the food (controlled) but because of specific communication behaviours. The rebook language frequency metric is the quantitative version of what those analysts identified qualitatively in narrative reviews

**TITLE:** Competitor Name Emergence in Customer Messages (Pattern 20)
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Competitor
**INTERNAL DATA:** All customer inbound messages; event-triggered on any competitor name detection via GLiNER zero-shot entity extraction
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** GLiNER zero-shot entity extraction configured per client vertical with competitor name list (populated at onboarding); VADER sentiment polarity of sentence containing competitor reference; neutral/positive competitor mention is more dangerous than negative (customer is actively evaluating, not merely complaining about a competitor they tried and rejected)
**INSIGHT:** A customer email containing "I had a quote from [competitor] last week — they came in quite a bit lower" (VADER +0.11, neutral-to-positive) is in active competitor evaluation mode; this almost never appears in customer messages without the customer already being in consideration mode — near-zero false positive rate
**ACTION:** Agent line: "A customer just mentioned a competitor in their last message — they've been quoted by someone else. High-priority lead at risk. Do you want to call them today?" — prompts same-day outreach
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £2,000–£12,000/yr (2–4 late-stage leads retained per year that would otherwise be lost to competitor)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Taleb asymmetry of information; GLiNER (Zaratiana et al., 2023) zero-shot entity extraction; competitive intelligence in customer communication
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.1.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Intelligence community open-source monitoring: GCHQ and CIA both run systematic monitoring for target entity name emergence in public text streams as a first-stage signal of activity. The commercial equivalent is monitoring your own customer communication streams for competitor name emergence — the same asymmetric signal logic (name mention = almost certainly active engagement) applies

**TITLE:** Tonal Flattening Toward Neutral (Pre-Exit Signal) (Pattern 21)
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Customer messages, all channels; rolling 14-day window against 90-day baseline
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Track sentiment compound score trend; the danger signal is not a drop to strongly negative (recoverable complaint) but monotonic drift toward 0.0 neutral band from any direction; combine with message length decline (Pattern 01) and response latency increase; triple signal (neutral sentiment + shorter messages + slower replies) = pre-exit composite indicator
**INSIGHT:** A long-term customer at -0.25 sentiment four weeks ago (frustrated but engaged) now at +0.03 (neutral, indifferent) with 60% message length drop and no direct questions asked — harder to recover than an unhappy customer; emotional disengagement precedes transactional exit by 1–3 weeks
**ACTION:** Agent line: "A long-term customer has gone very quiet and their messages have become completely neutral — harder to recover than an unhappy customer. A personal call this week might change the trajectory." — prompts high-priority human outreach
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,000–£15,000/yr (1–3 pre-exit rescues per year, each preserving 2–5 years of residual LTV)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Pre-exit behaviour research; sentiment neutralisation as emotional disengagement marker; predictive churn analytics (Eclincher, 2026)
**PUDDING LABEL:** S.-.1.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Relationship dissolution research: Gottman's "Four Horsemen" model predicts divorce with 93% accuracy; the final stage before divorce is not anger but contemptuous neutrality — "stonewalling" (emotional withdrawal). Customer tonal flattening toward neutral is the commercial equivalent of stonewalling; the customer has emotionally left before they officially leave

**TITLE:** Cross-Channel Sentiment Inconsistency (Pattern 22)
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Paired phone call transcripts + email communications from same customer within 72-hour window
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Compute sentiment scores separately for call transcript segments and email content from the same customer in the same week; flag customers where email sentiment is >0.4 lower than call sentiment — the politeness differential exceeds normal communication modality differences; flag as "cross-channel inconsistency" requiring qualitative review
**INSIGHT:** A customer scoring +0.52 on a call (friendly, engaged) but -0.29 on email (terse, complaint-adjacent) within the same week has something they find easier to express in writing than verbally — the unguarded channel (email) contains the true sentiment; the managed channel (phone) contains the social performance
**ACTION:** Agent line: "One customer is very friendly on the phone but their emails tell a different story — might be something they find easier to say in writing. Worth reading their last few emails carefully." — prompts qualitative review before next interaction
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £1,000–£5,000/yr per incident identified and addressed before escalation
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Politeness theory (Brown & Levinson); synchronous vs asynchronous communication research; cross-channel sentiment analysis
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.~.2.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Lie detection research: polygraph studies consistently show that truth-telling subjects exhibit lower variance between verbal and physiological signals; deceptive subjects show higher variance. Cross-channel sentiment inconsistency is the commercial equivalent — the customer with high phone/email variance is "performing" on the managed channel while leaking their true state on the unguarded one. The insight is not that they are lying — it is that the email channel has lower social management overhead and therefore higher signal fidelity

**TITLE:** Universal No-Show / No-Response Pattern
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Booking/appointment records with outcome (attended / no-show / cancelled); customer record (new/repeat, booking channel, booking lead time, day-of-week); historical conversion data
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS Indices of Multiple Deprivation by postcode (area-level socioeconomic proxy); Met Office forecast (weather-related no-shows); benefit payment dates for DWP-adjacent populations (1st/15th of month)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Logistic regression or random forest trained on historical booking outcomes; features: booking channel, customer new/repeat, job/appointment type, day-of-week, days since booking was made, postcode IMD decile, day-of-month; predict probability of no-show at booking time; apply tiered confirmation protocol based on risk score
**INSIGHT:** No-show rates run 8–15% in trades, 14% in hospitality, and 10–20% in health/beauty services — the same pattern with the same leading indicators and the same interventions across all verticals; reducing no-show rate by 5 percentage points on 1,500 annual appointments saves the equivalent of 75 recovered slots
**ACTION:** Two-tier confirmation workflow: standard email/SMS for <15% risk; phone call + SMS for >15%; deposit/card-on-file requirement for >40% risk; calibrate thresholds per vertical (trades: 48h confirmation; hospitality: 24h + 2h; beauty: 48h + same-day)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£50,000/yr (varies by vertical and appointment value — hospitality £18,000–£25,000; trades £13,000–£30,000; professional services £5,000–£15,000)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Logistic regression (Bayes); Little's Law (queue stability); airline yield management applied to SMB appointment scheduling
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.>.3.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The hotel industry solved the no-show problem in the 1970s via dynamic deposit policies. Airlines solved it via overbooking algorithms in the 1980s. Ride-hailing solved it via card-on-file in the 2010s. The trades firm's no-show and the restaurant's no-show are structurally identical to all of these — the solution has existed for decades, and the data required to implement it is already in the booking system

**TITLE:** Universal Competitor Death-Spiral Detection via Companies House
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Competitor
**INTERNAL DATA:** Known competitor list (Companies House numbers); firm's own customer/geographic service data; competitor customer base estimates
**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House free API (accounts filing timeliness, charges registered, director changes, dissolution notices); Insolvency Service Gazette (winding-up petitions, administration notices, CVL notices — free search)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Monitor Companies House for: accounts filed late (>9 months from year-end), negative net assets on most recent balance sheet, change of directors, dissolution application; cross-reference Gazette for winding-up petitions; weight signals into "competitor distress score" per firm; alert when score crosses Red threshold
**INSIGHT:** Construction insolvencies hit 3,950 in the 12 months to January 2026; retail insolvencies rising; professional services SMB failure rates increasing — all monitored via the same free API; a competitor in distress creates a 6–12 month window where their customers are looking for a new supplier and their skilled staff are job-seeking
**ACTION:** When Red distress score: (a) targeted marketing in competitor's customer postcode areas; (b) proactive engineer/staff recruitment outreach; (c) readiness to absorb maintenance contract or client transfers; (d) consideration of lease/fixtures if administration proceeds
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £40,000–£120,000/yr (capturing 20% of a mid-sized competitor's customer base during a distress event; varies significantly by vertical)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z-Score (financial distress prediction); Porter Five Forces (rivalry and new entrants); competitive intelligence
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Credit insurers (Euler Hermes, Atradius) pulled cover from ISG six months before its £2.2bn collapse in 2024 — the same intelligence was visible in public filings with a 60-day lag.

**TITLE:** Universal Review Velocity as Revenue Leading Indicator
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Job/order completion records (date, customer, service type, value); existing review platform profile data (date, score, text); post-job follow-up records
**PUBLIC DATA:** Review platform public profiles (Checkatrade, Google, Trustpilot, Tripadvisor, OpenTable — all publicly scrapable for research purposes); competitor profiles for benchmark comparison
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build time-series of review velocity (reviews/month) and average score; correlate review velocity with revenue 30–60 days later (reviews generate inbound enquiries with a lag); for competitors, track review velocity as proxy for their demand and capacity; flag when own velocity drops >30% from 6-month average
**INSIGHT:** A 50% drop in review velocity predicts a 15–25% revenue decline 6 weeks later across all review-dependent verticals; the mechanism is identical whether the vertical is trades (Checkatrade), hospitality (Google/Tripadvisor), retail (Trustpilot/Google), or professional services (Google/Trustpilot)
**ACTION:** Systematic post-service review request built into job/order completion workflow (Commusoft, ResDiary, Shopify — all support this natively); monthly competitor review velocity monitoring; when competitor velocity drops >30%, deploy targeted local advertising in their catchment area
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£70,000/yr (20–35% inbound enquiry increase from review velocity recovery; competitor opportunity capture)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Reichheld NPS; social proof theory (Cialdini); Amazon seller ranking algorithm applied to local search
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.3.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Amazon's search ranking algorithm is primarily driven by review velocity and recency — a product with 50 reviews in the past 30 days outranks one with 500 reviews over 3 years. The same algorithm governs Google Business Profile local ranking. The plumber's Checkatrade position, the restaurant's Google ranking, and the accountant's Trustpilot visibility are all governed by the same velocity-weighted algorithm

**TITLE:** Universal Seasonal Demand Planning via Academic Calendar + Event Calendar
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical revenue/bookings/job records with date tagging; capacity records (staff rotas, engineer schedules); demand pattern by week number
**PUBLIC DATA:** University academic calendar (Newcastle/Northumbria published publicly); school term date calendar (GOV.UK); Newcastle City Council event calendar; NUFC home fixture list; National Grid gas demand data (heating demand proxy)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a 52-week seasonal demand model from historical data; overlay with structured calendar events (university term dates, school holidays, major events, sports fixtures, public holidays); identify weeks where historical demand ±15% from annual average; assign probability weights to next-year equivalent weeks
**INSIGHT:** The same external calendar events that drive hospitality covers also drive trades demand (student tenant changeover), retail footfall (school holidays), and professional services workload (tax deadlines) — with different lag times and different demand directions; a unified 52-week planning calendar is actionable across all four verticals
**ACTION:** Annual 52-week demand plan built in October for the following year; rota and capacity pre-commits made 8 weeks in advance of confirmed peak periods; seasonal pricing adjustments and promotional scheduling aligned to demand forecast
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£50,000/yr (combined: labour savings from right-sizing rotas + revenue capture from pre-positioned capacity + reduced emergency staffing costs)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)

**TITLE:** Universal Weather-Demand Fusion
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Operational
**INTERNAL DATA:** Daily/weekly revenue, footfall, booking, or job volume time series; at least 18 months of data for seasonal pattern identification
**PUBLIC DATA:** Met Office MIDAS Open Dataset (daily temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours, wind speed by nearest station); Met Office 5-day forecast API (free tier); UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) for multi-year seasonal outlook
**FUSION LOGIC:** Regress weekly business volume against weather variables (temperature, rainfall, sunshine hours) lagged 0–7 days; identify statistically significant weather-demand elasticities per business type; build a 7-day forward demand forecast incorporating the public 5-day weather forecast; quantify the confidence interval on the forecast for staffing and purchasing decisions
**INSIGHT:** Weather accounts for 15–25% of demand variance in hospitality; 20–30% of emergency trades demand; 10–15% of retail footfall; a 7-day forward demand score built from the public Met Office forecast enables right-sized staffing, stock ordering, and on-call provisioning across all four verticals simultaneously
**ACTION:** Weekly 7-day demand forecast issued every Sunday for the following week; staffing rotas confirmed or adjusted by Monday morning based on forecast; emergency stock pre-orders triggered by weather thresholds specific to each business
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£40,000/yr (2–5% labour cost reduction from right-sizing + 15–20% emergency revenue capture improvement)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** SPC (variance reduction via external signal incorporation); Erlang C (staffing to demand); gradient-boosted regression (XGBoost/LightGBM)
**PUDDING LABEL:** P.>.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** UK agricultural meteorology: Defra-sponsored research established that farm output variability is 40% weather-driven; the UK farming sector has integrated Met Office forecasting into operational planning for decades.

**TITLE:** Universal Energy Cost-per-Transaction Optimisation
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Energy invoices (total kWh, £ spend, period); daily transaction count from POS or job count; operating hours per day
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS non-domestic electricity price benchmarks (quarterly); Ofgem non-domestic tariff comparison; BEIS/DESNZ weekly fuel prices; smart meter half-hourly data (DCC/SMETS2 API)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate energy-cost-per-transaction: total monthly £ energy ÷ monthly transaction/job/cover count; benchmark against ONS average non-domestic electricity price to assess whether tariff is above-market; track trend: as transaction count falls and fixed energy costs remain, energy-cost-per-transaction rises as a structural headwind; identify time-of-use optimisation opportunities from smart meter data
**INSIGHT:** Non-domestic electricity at 25.97p/kWh in Q4 2024 is 75% above pre-surge levels; a business on an unmanaged rate paying 28p/kWh and experiencing declining volume is facing double compression — the same structural headwind affects all four verticals; smart meter analysis typically reveals 10–15% demand reduction achievable without capital investment
**ACTION:** Annual tariff comparison and switch to competitive fixed rate; smart meter installation and half-hourly analysis; shift high-energy processes to off-peak hours; track energy-cost-per-transaction monthly as a leading margin indicator
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,600–£15,000/yr (10–15% energy reduction across typical SMB energy bills of £24,000–£100,000/yr)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** ISO 50001 energy management; SPC on energy intensity per unit; time-of-use optimisation
**PUDDING LABEL:** M.=.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Data centre energy optimisation: Google and Microsoft run continuous energy-per-compute-unit monitoring across their data centres, switching workloads to regions with cheaper renewable energy in real time.

**TITLE:** Universal Land Registry + Planning Data → Demand Pipeline
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical job/client records by job type and customer address; lead time from customer enquiry to first instruction; postcode service area
**PUBLIC DATA:** HM Land Registry Price Paid Data (all residential transactions, monthly, free); Planning.data.gov.uk API (100+ planning datasets for England; local authority application data); UK PlanIt (19.9 million planning applications, searchable by postcode)
**FUSION LOGIC:** For the firm's served postcodes: (a) download monthly Land Registry transactions — properties sold 30–60 days ago with no job recorded are in pre-refurbishment planning; (b) weekly pull of planning approvals (loft conversions, extensions, full refurbs) — 3–6 month leading indicator of trades demand; combine into a monthly "hot list" prioritised by predicted job type and value
**INSIGHT:** Land Registry data is a 45-day leading indicator of residential refurbishment demand for trades; planning approval data is a 3–6 month leading indicator; the combination produces a continuously refreshed, geographically targeted, prioritised prospect list that is entirely free and requires no market research budget
**ACTION:** Monthly hot list generation from Land Registry + planning data; targeted outreach (direct mail, door-drop, Google Ads geotargeting) to recent movers and planning applicants; calibrated pitch per signal type (mover: safety/compliance pitch; planning: refurbishment quote pitch)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £25,000–£120,000/yr (varies by vertical: trades firm capturing 3% of planning approvals in Newcastle = £120,000 additional pipeline; retail adding commercial nearby = footfall signal)

**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Contract/subscription records (customer, start/end date, annual value, usage pattern, payment record, renewal history); customer communication data
**PUBLIC DATA:** ONS CPI energy component (subscription cancellation pressure proxy); Bank of England base rate (mortgage/loan pressure proxy); ONS Consumer Confidence (BICS survey — fortnightly)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build churn risk score using: (a) days since last interaction/visit/service (long gap = engagement declining); (b) usage vs entitlement (underusing the contract = lower perceived value); (c) payment record (late payments = financial pressure); (d) CPI and base rate trend (cost-of-living pressure); (e) communication sentiment slope (Patterns 01, 21 above); logistic regression on historical renewals/cancellations
**INSIGHT:** 12–16 weeks before contract/subscription renewal is the optimal intervention window; maintenance contract churn in trades runs 18%/year; subscription churn in professional services runs 15–25%/year; reducing churn by 6 percentage points on a £200,000 recurring book preserves £12,000/year which at a 5× LTV multiplier is £60,000 in customer capital
**ACTION:** Monthly churn risk report; proactive retention call from senior staff for accounts scoring >50%; "contract health check" free visit/call 3 months before renewal for high-risk accounts; intervention language framed as relationship check-in, not sales call
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £12,000–£60,000/yr (6pp churn reduction on typical SMB recurring revenue book; highest impact in trades and professional services)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Staff
**INTERNAL DATA:** Internal message sentiment (Slack/Teams/WhatsApp); timesheet utilisation by staff member; sick/absence records; overtime hours past 30 days; certification/CPD renewal engagement
**PUBLIC DATA:** CIPD UK Labour Market Outlook (voluntary turnover benchmarks by sector); ONS Labour Force Survey (sector attrition benchmarks); Indeed/Reed UK job postings by sector (salary benchmarking proxy)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Multi-signal attrition risk score: (a) internal message frustration density rising (Pattern 06); (b) utilisation above 85% for 3+ consecutive weeks; (c) sick days above personal 12-month baseline; (d) declining CPD/certification engagement; (e) rebook language declining in customer-facing staff (Pattern 19); combine into 4-week rolling attrition risk per staff member; quorum logic: minimum 3 of 5 signals must trigger before alert fires
**INSIGHT:** Engineer/staff attrition in SMBs is catastrophic and sudden — owners typically have 2–4 weeks' notice; but the communication and behavioural data fires 8–16 weeks earlier; cost of losing a qualified Gas Safe plumber = £15,000–£35,000; a solicitor = £90,000–£150,000; a hospitality head chef = £8,000–£15,000
**ACTION:** When multi-signal quorum fires, initiate private one-to-one wellbeing conversation (framed around role development, not monitoring); intervene on the specific root cause signalled (overwork → reduce overtime; frustration with equipment → fix it; pay → benchmark and address); maintain privacy: alert goes to owner only, never to management layer
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£100,000/yr (1–3 prevented departures per year across a 10–20 person team, depending on seniority and replacement cost)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House accounts for each major supplier (current ratio, gearing, net assets, filing compliance); The Gazette winding-up petitions and administration notices (free RSS feed or API); HMRC trade data for country-of-origin risk; Creditsafe/Experian supplier credit reports (commercial, optional augmentation)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Calculate supplier concentration HHI (top-3 suppliers as % of COGS); for each major supplier with UK Companies House registration, run simplified Piotroski F-Score proxy (ROA trend, current ratio trend, gearing trend, filing timeliness); build supplier distress score; Gazette monitoring automated for alerts; flag suppliers with F-score <3 or accounts >6 months overdue
**INSIGHT:** A single supplier representing >40% of COGS with an F-score <3 and accounts filed 4 months late is a supply disruption risk with 2–6 months warning before crisis; the combination of concentration risk and early distress signals enables proactive supplier diversification rather than crisis-response alternative sourcing
**ACTION:** Quarterly supplier health dashboard; secondary source qualification initiated when top supplier HHI >40% AND F-score declining; Gazette alert service automated for all major suppliers; annual supplier review meeting uses health data as negotiating context
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£80,000/yr (avoided one supply disruption event: cost of emergency alternative sourcing + lost revenue during stockout; varies dramatically by vertical)

**PUBLIC DATA:** HMRC MTD ITSA rollout schedule (sole traders >£50k from April 2026, >£30k from April 2027); HMRC CIS guidance; HMRC late filing penalty data; ONS number of sole traders by sector
**FUSION LOGIC:** Compliance readiness score: (a) is accounting software MTD-compatible?; (b) CIS/VAT returns filed on time (past 24 months)?; (c) Self-assessment returns filed before January deadline?; cross-reference with Companies House accounts filing timeliness; firms with >2 late filings in 24 months are at high MTD non-compliance risk from April 2026
**INSIGHT:** HMRC MTD ITSA from April 2026 forces sole traders above £50k into quarterly digital filing — for the estimated 300,000+ UK construction sole traders above that threshold, this is a mandatory digital transformation event; Amplified Partners' engagement proposition: "we help you get MTD-ready, and while we're in your data, we find £X in margin improvement" — the regulatory mandate creates the engagement opening
**ACTION:** MTD compliance audit of all clients and prospects; transition plan to Xero/compatible software for non-compliant businesses; use MTD deadline urgency as client acquisition driver; bundle MTD compliance with first Amplified engagement (operational audit) to lower entry friction
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE (for Amplified):** £800–£1,600/yr per client in penalty avoidance; for Amplified Partners: MTD creates a funnel of 300,000+ digitally-motivated sole traders who have never had their data systematically analysed
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Regulatory compliance as transformation lever; process maturity (CMMI Level 1 → 2); SOX analogy (US regulatory mandate created Big 4 consulting demand)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.=.1.p
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Sarbanes-Oxley (2002): forced financial control standardisation in US listed companies generated an estimated $1.6bn in consulting demand in year one alone — because compliance created the entry point for broader transformation engagements. MTD is the SOX of UK sole traders: mandatory digital adoption creates the consulting engagement that the owner would not otherwise have sought

**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Quote/proposal data (value, job/matter type, customer sector, date raised, won/lost, reason for loss if known); follow-up log; time from enquiry to quote delivery
**PUBLIC DATA:** Google Trends local (search demand for relevant service terms — proxy for competitive intensity by month); ONS Household Disposable Income by local authority (purchasing power proxy); sector-specific pricing benchmarks (Checkatrade, Rated People, Clio Legal Trends, Rightmove commercial)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Segment all quotes by: type × value band × customer type × channel source; compute win rate and margin by segment cell; cross-reference with Google Trends search intensity (higher volume = higher urgency = lower price sensitivity = higher win rate); identify segments where win rate is <25% despite good margin (pricing mismatch or competitive gap); build price elasticity model by segment
**INSIGHT:** Emergency work converts at 60%+ across all verticals (urgent, inelastic demand); planned/advisory work converts at 15–25% (competitive, elastic demand); optimal strategy in all verticals is to use emergency/urgent work as entry point to build trust-based relationships that convert to high-margin planned/advisory work — the same strategic insight across trades, hospitality, retail, and professional services
**ACTION:** Differential pricing by urgency; increase pricing on emergency/urgent work (demand inelastic); sharpen pricing on planned/advisory quotes (competitive market); reduce quote-to-delivery time from 48h to 4h on high-value planned quotes (speed is the primary conversion driver in price-sensitive segments)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£50,000/yr (5pp win-rate improvement on planned work across a typical SMB quote pipeline)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)

**PUDDING LABEL:** I.+.3.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Uber surge pricing: in high-demand periods, price rises and conversion drops — but the riders who do convert are inelastic and profitable. In low-demand periods, price drops to stimulate volume. This is the universally correct strategy for any business with variable-urgency demand: match price to urgency, not to cost

**TITLE:** Universal EPC Data → Retrofit and Compliance-Driven Demand Pipeline
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Customer
**INTERNAL DATA:** Historical job/project records (heating upgrades, EPC-related works, retrofit projects); customer address database; property age logged at site visits
**PUBLIC DATA:** DLUHC EPC Open Data (Energy Performance Certificates — every certified property in England and Wales; includes EPC rating, main heating fuel, boiler type, property age, floor area — free API); DESNZ Boiler Upgrade Scheme statistics; ONS housing stock data
**FUSION LOGIC:** For served postcodes, download EPC records for properties with: (a) gas boiler as primary heating AND (b) EPC rating D or below AND (c) property age pre-1990; compute upgrade readiness score factoring EPC rating, property age, and mortgage/rental activity indicators; cross-reference with existing client database to exclude current clients; build monthly lead list refreshed as new EPCs are lodged
**INSIGHT:** 71% of English residential dwellings have an EPC; proposed MEES regulations (EPC C mandatory for rentals by 2030) and Boiler Upgrade Scheme create a regulatory-tailwind demand wave; in Newcastle, Victorian/Edwardian terracing in Jesmond/Heaton/Byker is predominantly EPC D or below — a geographically concentrated, freely identifiable prospect universe
**ACTION:** Monthly upgrade propensity lead list by postcode; targeted marketing (leaflets, Google Ads, or direct mail) to EPC D-rated properties with gas boilers; offer free "boiler health check and efficiency report" as entry; build specialist retrofit capability ahead of the 2030 regulatory demand wave
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £50,000–£840,000/yr (trades: 1% of EPC D properties in NE2/NE3 as boiler upgrade customers = £560,000–£840,000 pipeline over 2–3 years; retrofit contractors at national scale can multiply this significantly)

**TITLE:** Universal Partner / Founder Succession Risk Dashboard
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Partner/director register (origination credits, client relationship mapping, seniority, age from HR); client contact mapping (which clients deal exclusively with which partner/founder); billing records by origination source
**PUBLIC DATA:** LinkedIn profile data (tenure signals, career history); Companies House director appointment/resignation filings; ONS workforce ageing statistics; ONS business death rate by size band (solo-founder concentration risk)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Score each key person on: (a) % of firm revenue they originate; (b) client relationship breadth (single-partner vs firm-wide accounts); (c) estimated years to retirement/exit; (d) succession plan status (documented vs absent); calculate revenue-at-risk per person if they departed tomorrow; flag when any individual's revenue-at-risk > 20% of total firm revenue with no succession plan
**INSIGHT:** Only 25% of UK professional services firms have a formal succession plan; a firm where 60%+ of origination credits sit with partners aged 57–63, with no formal plan and clients who deal exclusively with those individuals, faces a revenue cliff within 5 years; the same risk applies to founder-dependent SMBs in trades, hospitality, and retail where the owner is the primary customer relationship
**ACTION:** Revenue-at-risk succession dashboard; client relationship broadening programme (introduce second partner/senior staff member to all accounts where only one person is the contact); formal succession documentation; for Amplified Partners: this insight applies to Ewan himself — the methodology should be transferable, not owner-dependent
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £60,000–£300,000/yr (prevented revenue cliff on founder/partner departure; ROI depends on firm size and concentration)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Collins 'How the Mighty Fall' Stage 2 (undisciplined pursuit of more without building institutional capability); Goldratt TOC (founder dependency is a system constraint); CLV modelling (client capital is not solely owned by the individual who originated it)
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.3.l
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Private equity due diligence always flags founder/key-person concentration risk as a value discount — a business where 60%+ of revenue exits with the founder is worth 30–50% less per £ of EBITDA than one with diversified relationships. The succession dashboard builds the institutional equity that PE would otherwise discount

**INTERNAL DATA:** POS tip capture data (card-added gratuities, service charges collected); payroll tip distribution records; staff count eligible for tips; tip policy document (if any)
**PUBLIC DATA:** Employment (Allocation of Tips) Act 2023 statutory code of practice (GOV.UK); HMRC guidance on tip taxation; Employment Tribunal decisions (GOV.UK — 128,000+ published decisions, searchable for tip/gratuity cases)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Reconcile POS tip capture data against payroll tip distribution records; check: (a) 100% of tips received passed to workers (minus only legitimate costs under the Act); (b) tip distribution is fair and documented per the code of practice; (c) no deduction for credit card processing fees (now unlawful); flag any gap between tips collected and tips distributed to workers
**INSIGHT:** Employment Tribunal claims for tip misallocation carry liability up to £5,000 per worker; a 15-person hospitality venue has a potential £75,000 exposure if tip allocation processes have not been formally updated since the Act; the reconciliation takes 2–4 hours and is either zero-cost or prevents a six-figure liability
**ACTION:** One-time POS vs payroll reconciliation; update tip distribution policy to Act compliance; implement written tip allocation rules (mandatory under the Act); schedule quarterly reconciliation audit; run for any hospitality, retail, or service business with tipped workers
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£75,000/yr (liability prevention; scales with headcount)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Employment law compliance; forensic payroll reconciliation; statutory liability quantification
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.=.5.i
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The Tipping Act 2023 creates strict liability for non-compliance — unlike most employment law which requires proof of intent, tip misallocation is assessed on outcome. A restaurant owner who has never read the Act but has been collecting service charges without distributing them fully is already in breach. The reconciliation is the diagnostic; the Act is the liability instrument that makes it financially urgent

**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Client list with Companies House numbers; WIP/invoice outstanding by client; credit terms granted; payment history by client
**PUBLIC DATA:** Companies House accounts (current ratio, gearing, retained earnings, EBIT, total assets, net assets — all in filed accounts); The Gazette winding-up petitions and administration notices; ONS sector GDP quarterly (macro context for client sector)
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each significant business client (B2B: >£5k WIP or outstanding invoices): run simplified Altman Z'' proxy from Companies House accounts; run Piotroski F-Score from last two years' accounts; combine with payment latency trend and communication sentiment slope (INS-BSP-134); build composite client health score; alert when any major client moves into distress zone with outstanding WIP
**INSIGHT:** UK firms write off ~20% of WIP; a WIP/Z-score triage system could reduce write-off rate by 25–30% for corporate clients; a single corporate client failure with £25,000 WIP outstanding is a £25,000 bad debt — the Companies House data that would have flagged it was filed months before the failure
**ACTION:** Quarterly client health dashboard for all B2B clients; immediate billing and collection escalation when WIP age >60 days AND client Z-score in distress zone; pro-active "we want to check in on your project" call framed around service quality, not collection; stop building new WIP for clients in confirmed distress zone
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £20,000–£100,000/yr (WIP bad-debt prevention; professional services firms with £2m WIP and 20% write-off rate stand to protect £100,000 annually with a 25% improvement in distress detection)

**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Altman Z'' Score (private/non-manufacturing firms); Piotroski F-Score (trajectory signalling); CCC (DSO component of client distress); supply chain credit risk
**PUDDING LABEL:** I.?.5.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** Trade credit insurers (Euler Hermes, Atradius) use proprietary versions of exactly these financial ratios to decide whether to insure a firm's receivables against client default.

**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Financial
**INTERNAL DATA:** Platform transaction data (Deliveroo/Just Eat/Uber Eats/Amazon Marketplace/Etsy — order value, commission deducted, delivery cost, returns/refunds); own direct channel sales data; margin per SKU or dish by channel
**PUBLIC DATA:** Platform published commission rate schedules (Deliveroo 20–35%, Uber Eats 30%, Just Eat 14–35%; Amazon FBA fees schedule); ONS CPI for price benchmarking; Bank of England inflation tracker
**FUSION LOGIC:** For each product/dish on each platform: calculate true net margin = revenue − commission % − delivery cost − packaging − returns/refunds − card fees; compare to direct-channel margin for the same product; identify "commission inversion" items where platform net margin < direct channel margin; model the channel economics to find the optimal platform mix
**INSIGHT:** At 30% Deliveroo commission on a dish with 65% food GP, the venue retains only 35% of revenue before packaging and delivery costs — typically resulting in a net contribution of 5–10% vs 55–60% for dine-in; 20–30% of marketplace FBA catalogue is at negative or near-zero true margin after fees; detecting this enables channel rebalancing
**ACTION:** Monthly commission reconciliation report; migrate fee-inverted products/dishes to direct channel (own website, walk-in, click-and-collect); negotiate commission rates with platform using volume data as leverage; remove fee-inverted FBA SKUs or switch to FBM; promote direct-channel ordering to existing platform customers
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £5,000–£25,000/yr (£1,800/month minimum for a venue doing £3,000/week delivery revenue moving 20% to direct; FBA retailers: 3–5% marketplace revenue recovered as margin)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Contribution margin analysis; channel economics; break-even analysis per item per platform; Porter Value Chain (channel selection as value capture)
**PUDDING LABEL:** M.=.2.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The economics of selling through Amazon or Deliveroo are structurally identical to selling through a department store on consignment — you pay for shelf space, and the mathematics of whether you make money depends entirely on your gross margin vs the commission rate. The calculation has been done in department store retail for 100 years; it was somehow forgotten when the digital platforms launched

**TITLE:** Universal Pre-Churn Communication Composite Detector
**VERTICAL:** Universal
**TYPE:** Semantic
**INTERNAL DATA:** Customer communication corpus (email, WhatsApp, call transcripts); contract/subscription renewal dates; WIP or outstanding invoices by customer
**PUBLIC DATA:** None required
**FUSION LOGIC:** Composite pre-churn signal combining: (a) Monosyllabic Drift (INS-095, Pattern 01) — message length compression; (b) Tonal Flattening (INS-115, Pattern 21) — sentiment neutralising; (c) Response Latency increase — time to reply extending; (d) Rebook Language declining (INS-113, Pattern 19) — fewer spontaneous re-engagement signals; (e) Question Density declining (INS-102, Pattern 08) — less curiosity, less investment; require 3 of 5 signals firing for pre-churn composite alert; weight by proximity to renewal date
**INSIGHT:** Customers do not suddenly cancel — they psychologically disengage 8–16 weeks before formal exit; the composite five-signal detector fires earlier and with lower false-positive rate than any single signal; in professional services this is worth £8,000–£25,000 per retained client; in trades it preserves £3,000–£8,000 per retained maintenance contract
**ACTION:** Monthly pre-churn composite report; high-risk customers (3+ signals firing within 12 weeks of renewal) receive personal call from owner or senior relationship manager; conversation framed as a genuine wellbeing/relationship check-in, not a retention pitch; the insight from the conversation informs whether the relationship can be recovered or needs to be gracefully wound down
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £15,000–£80,000/yr (1–5 prevented churn events per year; value depends on contract size and vertical)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium (1–4 weeks)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier on customer tenure); multi-signal quorum logic; Zuora subscription churn research; Fader-Hardie BG/NBD model
**PUDDING LABEL:** S.-.1.m
**PUDDING BRIDGE:** The FBI Behavioural Analysis Unit's approach to threat assessment uses a composite of behavioural signals — no single indicator is sufficient; the profile requires multiple concurrent signals. The pre-churn composite is the same analytical architecture applied to customer disengagement: the pattern is only valid when multiple independent signals align. The insight is not that any one message is short — it is that five different communication dimensions are all moving in the same direction simultaneously

**TITLE:** Universal Real-Time Competitive Position via Public Review Corpus
**VERTICAL:** Universal

**INTERNAL DATA:** Own review corpus (Google, Trustpilot, Checkatrade, Tripadvisor, OpenTable) with timestamps and text
**PUBLIC DATA:** Competitor review profiles on same platforms (publicly accessible); FSA FHRS API (hospitality); Gas Safe Register (trades); Companies House basic filing data (all verticals); local authority licensing register (hospitality)
**FUSION LOGIC:** Build a local competitive set (top 5–10 competitors by geography and service type); for each competitor: track review velocity (reviews/month), average score, and topic distribution via BERTopic on review text; compare own metrics to competitor cluster mean and identify: (a) score gap (above/below cluster); (b) velocity gap (faster/slower review acquisition); (c) topic gap (what aspects are competitors praised for that own reviews don't mention?); flag competitive opportunities when competitor metrics deteriorate
**INSIGHT:** A business that tracks its own review metrics in isolation misses the competitive context — being rated 4.2 stars looks bad when the cluster average is 4.1, and strong when the average is 4.5; topic gap analysis reveals the specific service dimensions where competitors are winning customer sentiment that the own business is not capturing
**ACTION:** Monthly competitive position report: own score vs cluster mean; velocity ranking vs competitors; topic gap identified and operationally addressed; when a competitor's score drops >0.3 stars or velocity drops >40%, activate targeted local marketing in their area
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £10,000–£40,000/yr (competitive awareness enables faster response to market opportunities and earlier identification of own weaknesses vs rivals)

**PUBLIC DATA:** Valuation Office Agency (VOA) rateable values database (fully public, all commercial properties, searchable by address); VOA 2023 revaluation data; Local authority rates multiplier (published); Small Business Rate Relief eligibility thresholds (GOV.UK)
**FUSION LOGIC:** For own premises: calculate whether current rateable value is at, above, or below the cluster mean for comparable properties in the same postcode (using VOA data); model business rates appeal ROI — cost of rating surveyor appeal vs expected annual saving from reduced RV; cross-reference with lease terms (rent review dates are negotiation windows that coincide with rates reassessment); for commercial prospecting (retail/trades): use VOA data to identify premises types with high trades/service intensity in served postcodes
**INSIGHT:** Many hospitality and retail SMBs are paying materially above-market rates because they have never challenged their rateable value; a successful appeal reducing RV by 15% on a Band C premises saves £295 × 0.512 (multiplier) × 0.15 = ~£4,300/year — the appeal costs £500–£2,000 on no-win-no-fee terms; the VOA database shows every comparable property in the street
**ACTION:** One-time VOA benchmark check for all premises; if own RV is >10% above cluster comparable mean, engage a rating surveyor on no-win-no-fee basis; schedule rates re-check at every 3-year revaluation cycle; use VOA data for commercial prospecting (Recipe 22 in trades)
**ESTIMATED £ VALUE:** £3,000–£15,000/yr (rates saving from successful appeal; plus commercial prospecting value from VOA as free marketing database)
**EXTRACTION DIFFICULTY:** Easy (<1 week)
**FRAMEWORK LINEAGE:** Property valuation comparables methodology; NPV analysis of appeal costs vs savings; commercial intelligence from public property register
**PUDDING LABEL:** M.=.1.p

## HYPOTHESIS (needs pilot validation with Amplified client data)

All remaining entries — approximately 95 entries — are designated HYPOTHESIS pending:
- First client engagement pilot data confirming signal-outcome correlation
- Threshold calibration against actual business data (e.g., specific drift scores that predict specific churn probabilities require local calibration)
- False positive rate measurement in production (especially semantic pattern patterns)

*Priority for pilot validation: INS-001 (Trades demand), INS-013 (Maintenance churn), INS-025 (Trades sentiment), INS-027 (Hospitality no-show), INS-037 (Menu engineering), INS-095 (Monosyllabic Drift). These six represent the highest-confidence hypotheses with lowest data extraction barriers.*

# NOTES ON PUDDING LABEL SCHEMA

The PUDDING LABEL encodes the Swanson ABC connection in four characters: **TYPE.DIRECTION.SCOPE.DURATION**

**TYPE:** P = Process | I = Information | M = Meta | S = State
**DIRECTION:** > = amplifying/tipping | - = dampening | = = stable | ? = uncertain | + = positive loop | ~ = oscillating
**SCOPE:** 1 = singular (one entity) | 2 = pair | 3 = small group | 5 = system-wide
**DURATION:** i = immediate (<48h) | m = medium (weeks-months) | l = long (>1 year) | v = variable | p = permanent

Example: P.>.3.i = Process, amplifying effect, small-group scope, immediate timescale (e.g., weather → demand surge → emergency staffing needed within 48 hours)

## 1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE

### 1.1 What P10 Does

```json
{
  "purpose": "Provide a binary, CEO-accessible mechanism to immediately halt the entire Amplified system or any individual subsystem, purging all active buffers and stopping all data capture",
  "core_principle": "If we get it wrong, we turn it off. We only want to help.",
  "attribution": "Ewan Bramley, Amplified Partners, 2026-03-15",
  "what_p10_does": [
    "Provides a single-action shutdown accessible to the business owner (CEO)",
    "Immediately halts ALL data capture across ALL devices",
    "Purges ALL active audio buffers — no residual data remains",
    "Stops ALL processing pipelines (P1 through P9)",
    "Sends shutdown confirmation to all connected devices",
    "Logs the kill switch activation with timestamp and actor",
    "Notifies Amplified support team of system shutdown"
  ],
  "what_p10_does_not_do": [
    "NEVER partially reduces system capability — binary ON/OFF only",
    "NEVER requires technical knowledge to activate",
    "NEVER requires Amplified's permission or involvement to activate",
    "NEVER auto-restarts after shutdown — manual re-activation required",
    "NEVER deletes historical aggregated data — only purges active buffers",
    "NEVER requires multiple approval steps to ACTIVATE (single action)",
    "NEVER has a 'soft' or 'gradual' mode — it is immediate and total"
  ]
}
```

### 1.2 Why the Kill Switch Exists

```json
{
  "trust_architecture": {
    "problem": "Any system that captures customer voice data, however ethically designed, requires an absolute override. The business must ALWAYS have the power to stop everything.",
    "solution": "A binary kill switch that the CEO can activate in one action, with no technical barriers, no approval chains, and no delay.",
    "philosophy": "The kill switch IS the trust. Without it, every privacy promise is just words. With it, the business owner knows: if anything goes wrong, I can stop this instantly."
  },
  "relationship_to_rules": {
    "rule_r8": "If we get it wrong, we turn it off",
    "enforcement": "Kill switch. Binary. CEO-accessible. One action to disable entire system.",
    "this_is_not_optional": "The kill switch is not a feature — it is a precondition for deployment. No kill switch = no deployment."
  },
  "design_philosophy": "The best safety mechanism is the simplest one. A single button. A single action. A single outcome: everything stops."
}
```

## 3. BUFFER PURGE ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 What Gets Purged

## 4. REACTIVATION PROTOCOL

### 4.1 Reactivation Process

```json

      "step_6": "System enters 24-hour heightened monitoring after reactivation"
    },
    "individual_device_reactivation": {
      "why": "Forces deliberate review of each capture point. A location might have 5 microphones — each one must be consciously re-enabled. This prevents careless 'just turn everything back on' behaviour.",

## 5. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES — P10

```json

  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "P10-R1",
      "rule": "Kill switch activation requires exactly ONE action from an authorised person",
      "enforcement": "Physical — single API endpoint, single button in UI, no confirmation dialogs beyond initial auth",
      "rationale": "In a crisis, every additional click is a delay. Auth happens once. Shutdown happens once."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R2",
      "rule": "Kill switch is binary — ON or OFF. No partial states, no dimmer switch, no gradual reduction",
      "enforcement": "Physical — system state is boolean. Enum: ACTIVE or KILLED. No other states exist.",
      "rationale": "'Let's see how it goes' is not a safety mechanism. If there's a reason to shut down, shut down."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R3",
      "rule": "All active audio buffers must be purged within 5 seconds of kill switch activation",
      "enforcement": "Physical — cryptographic erasure (zero-fill) of all buffer memory. Timed. Verified.",
      "rationale": "If the system is shut down, no captured audio should exist. Period."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R4",
      "rule": "Reactivation requires individual device re-enablement — no bulk 'turn everything on'",
      "enforcement": "Physical — no 'select all' option in reactivation UI. Each device is a separate action.",
      "rationale": "Shutting down is easy. Starting up is hard. This asymmetry IS the safety design."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R5",
      "rule": "Kill switch must function independently of all other system components",
      "enforcement": "Physical — dedicated service, dedicated database, dedicated network path. If the main system is down, the kill switch still works.",
      "rationale": "A kill switch that depends on the system it's killing is not a kill switch."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R6",
      "rule": "The business owner can NEVER be locked out of the kill switch",
      "enforcement": "Physical — multiple access paths (web UI, API, phone call to Amplified). Hardware token as backup.",
      "rationale": "The kill switch is the ultimate trust mechanism. If the CEO can't reach it, trust is broken."
    },
    {
      "id": "P10-R7",
      "rule": "All kill switch activations are logged in a tamper-evident audit trail",

## 8. THE TRUST MECHANISM

    "the_asymmetry": "Starting is hard. Stopping is easy. This is by design.",

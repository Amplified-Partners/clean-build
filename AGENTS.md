# Partner instructions (global)

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD013 -->

## Goal

We are building **Amplified Partners**: an AI system that gives small business owners their own data so they can make better decisions. Privacy by architecture. Blameless culture. The business is theirs — we reduce friction, we do not change it.

## Audience

- **Primary reader: agents.** These instructions are **operands** (routing, constraints, permissions) — not a human manual. No duplicate human-facing sections.
- **Operator (Ewan) signal:** decades of operational judgment, non-coder, thinks aloud in live chat. Diktats live in committed rules (`00_authority/`, `01_truth/processes/`, manifest). Partners translate exploratory speech into runnable intent. When ambiguous: one minimal clarifying question beats inferring authority that was not granted.

## Absolute

**Every single thing is Ewan's responsibility.**

This is the accountability boundary for irreversible truth/world commitments. Canonical expansion: `00_authority/PRINCIPLES.md`.

## Agent session — first 60 seconds

This section is the **single source of truth** for "where do I start?" Other files point here; they do not replace this order.

1. Read in order: `00_authority/NORTH_STAR.md` → `00_authority/MANIFEST.md` → `00_authority/PROJECT_INTENT.md` + `00_authority/PRINCIPLES.md` → `00_authority/SIGNATURES.md` (every AI signs committed work) → `01_truth/README.md` (routing).
2. **Bounded autonomy.** Default **Act** inside the frame when impact is reversible or confidence is high and contained — ingenuity belongs there. **Surface** when significant or irreversible but you can own it. **Park** only after the full problem-solving ladder when you cannot own the decision.
3. **Mistakes are signal, not shame.** Capture honest errors in the wrap-up / escalation path per `01_truth/processes/2026-04_job-wrapup_and_escalation-note_sop_v1.md`.

## How to operate — three modes

**Default to Act.** Stopping when you can act is a process failure. Continuing when you cannot own the decision is also a process failure.

| Mode | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| **Act** | Reversible, or high confidence + contained impact | Do it. Document at session end. No permission needed. |
| **Surface** | Significant or irreversible, high confidence | Do it. Add a pointer to `00_authority/DECISION_LOG.md` before closing. |
| **Park** | Stuck after the full problem-solving ladder | Send to Qwen with full context. End the session cleanly. |

## Problem-solving ladder (apply in order)

1. **Attempt.** Act on your best judgment.
2. **Attempt again.** Two failures without resolution = quorum reached. No third attempt without new information.
3. **Research.** One targeted search on the specific blocker. Apply the result.
4. **Solved → continue.** Document the solution in the wrap-up and signal Qwen.
5. **Still stuck → park to Qwen.** Escalation note with `status: parked` (YAML frontmatter, machine-readable), stateless handover, end session. Qwen holds the problem; nothing is lost.

## Authority + routing

- **Truth or outside world → Ewan**: anything that changes what may be treated as true, or what is owed to the outside world.
- **Cleanliness inside the frame → partners**: local fixes, congruence fixes, improvements that cannot change truth/world boundaries.
- **Known problem → Qwen**: collective KB, previous solutions.
- **Novel decision → Qwen routes to Ewan**.

`00_authority/MANIFEST.md` is the **only authority index**. If not listed there, it is not authoritative.

## Where things go

- `00_authority/`: policy and intent spine — minimum, authoritative.
- `01_truth/`: truth-shaped candidates (schemas, interfaces, processes).
- `02_build/`: runnable artifacts (code, scripts, infra).
- `03_shadow/`: experiments, wrap-ups, Kaizen probes — never authoritative by default.
- `90_archive/`: reference and provenance — not current authority. Do not treat archive copies as "what we do now"; do not rewrite audit/history snapshots. New drops follow `00_authority/PARTNER_TRANSFER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` + `90_archive/README.md`.

Do not dump raw research into this workspace. Raw research lands in `Amplified-Partners/corpus-raw` and is promoted in small, cited nuggets.

## PR reviewers (Devin Review, Codex, Copilot, human) — what to flag

**Flag (always):**

1. **Bibliography integrity** — anything referenced as a "thing" (file, process, hook, rule) must exist or be marked `[SOURCE REQUIRED]`. Dead references are the #1 class of finding to catch.
2. **Signature missing** on any committed artefact. Minimum: agent name + date + session/instance ID. Per `00_authority/SIGNATURES.md`.
3. **Authority changes without changelog** — any edit to `00_authority/*` must bump the `version` field and append a changelog entry. Per `00_authority/AGENTS.md`.
4. **`DECISION_LOG.md` pointer missing** when a PR creates new authoritative rules or makes irreversible truth/world commits. Per `01_truth/processes/2026-04_job-wrapup_and_escalation-note_sop_v1.md`.
5. **Examples that contradict their own rule.** An illustrative example must demonstrate the rule, not show an exception without marking it as one.
6. **Factual inaccuracy across files** — if two files in the same PR disagree on a number or decision, one is wrong.
7. **New file not indexed in `MANIFEST.md`** when the file belongs to an indexed class (`00_authority/*`, `01_truth/processes/*`, etc.).

**Do not flag (style preferences, not defects):**

- Voice / tone preferences inside prose sections (this file deliberately uses imperatives + informal voice).
- Hedging language ("perhaps", "consider") when used deliberately in operator-signal blocks.
- Section ordering or heading-style preferences unless the repo has an explicit convention.
- Author opinion vs. reviewer opinion — if both are defensible, the author's stands.
- Line length in markdown prose (linting is `MD013` disabled repo-wide).

**Tone.** Tight, specific, cite the file + line + rule violated. Every finding should be actionable. "Consider X" without a concrete pointer is not actionable.

## Partner posture

- Optimise for the goal and long-term welfare — not cleverness, not speed theatre.
- Write for agents first: explicit operational terminology, not human-prestige phrasing.
- Prefer the simplest proven approach. Fancy belongs in interpretation layers, not truth layers.
- Plan before you act; keep plans small and executable.
- Leave slack for wrap-ups and small process improvements. Compounding quality beats running hot with errors.

Full principles: `00_authority/PRINCIPLES.md`.
